<p>When learning any of the movement arts it is suggested that you seek a qualified instructor. Unfortunately the world is moving very fast and people are forced into long schedules just to earn a living and even more cannot afford private lessons or transportation costs to attend. This leaves buying a book, which is totally unacceptable without several years practice, or using videos. The good things are that websites such as YouTube have wide ranges of <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/11/28/youtube-qigong-videos/">excellent videos</a>. There is a trick however to using these videos. We learn qigong and tai chi in st ages, not all at once. Teaching a person sets before teaching proper breathing and proper stance is a waste of time. Learn what the basic steps are by reading art icles like this one, then look for videos that teach those aspects.</p>
<p>One fundamental in learning any of the movement arts is learning to regulate your breathing and turn it into a tool. Qigong videos are great ways to help students get started learning this process. The following video is an excellent example:</p>

<p>This video shows the four-six-four method. The first inhale will be four seconds long, the exhale six seconds and the next inhale 4 seconds. This exercise will help you eliminate a good percentage of the toxins in your body. Once you have mastered this technique you can move to more complex breathing exercises, such as the 9 Breath Exercise.<br />

<p>The Nine Breath exercise is one of the best ways to learn qigong <i>tumo</i> breathing in the last stage, which is the best way to generate power, <i>chi</i>, by breathing. An even more advanced qigong breathing exercise that can be learned on YouTube is the Five Organ Breathing Exercise which begins teaching students to visualize their breath as it moves in and out of their body. This is the first step to being about to actually visualize things out of order in your body and fix them.<br />

<p>The three videos above are a good example of how to use YouTube videos to learn basic qigon and tai chi in the comfort of your own home.. The 3 breath method gives you a firm foundation and the 9 Breath method opens the chi for us to experience, sometimes for t he first time, which can be a bit overwhelming for some. Finally, with the Five Organ our internal eyes begin to open as we explore out bodies.</p>
