<p>I teach regular tai chi workshops in Farmington, ME. It all started when a Brookline Tai Chi student moved back up to Maine and asked me to come teach her meditation group (thanks, Iris!).</p>
<h2>Tai Chi Fundamentals</h2><br />
We started by going through some basics of tai chi: sensitivity, posture, alignment, and body mechanics. Here's an example of exercises from our first workshop:</p>
<p><object width="560" height="345" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/yu9gAYbhZi4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="560" height="345" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/yu9gAYbhZi4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<h2>Wu Style Short Form</h2><br />
Since then, we've been working on the different sections of the Wu Style Short Form, just like we teach at Brookline Tai Chi:</p>
<p><object width="420" height="345" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/elUHOIPIkvE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="420" height="345" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/elUHOIPIkvE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>Each workshop focuses on a different part of the form.</p>
<h2>How You Can Join</h2><br />
The really cool part is that the group meets each week to practice together. I'm sure you know the "workshop syndrome" of getting excited about something new you learn in a weekend, only to lose it a few months later because you never practice. It's hard to keep it up, but because these guys get together on a regular basis and get frequent input from instructors, they've done a great job developing their tai chi forms!</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning tai chi, not only will you get the depth of a workshop, you'll get the follow-through and support of a regular training group.</p>
