<p><strong>NEW ONLINE COURSE:</strong> <a href="/courses/eyes-and-visual-training/">Eyes and Visual Training</a></p>
<h2>Longevity Qigong Classes for More Energy</h2><br />
I teach regular weekly classes in Wu Style Tai Chi and the <a href="http://www.energyarts.com">Energy Arts</a> Qigong system at <a href="http://www.brooklinetaichi.org">Brookline Tai Chi</a>. New classes start every 7-8 weeks! Qigong is all about integrating the natural rhythms inside your body. I love exploring these patterns and rhythms and working with people to help them generate smooth internal flows --- that's what all the group classes I teach are about, whether it's a tai chi or qigong class. For more on the Energy Arts Qigong System, <a href="http://www.energyarts.com/Energy-Arts-System/Frantzis-Core-Chi-Gung-Program/index.html" target="_blank">go here</a>.</p>
<h2>Restorative Movement Coaching for Less Pain</h2><br />
<strong> </strong>I work one-on-one with people who want to heal old injuries, achieve pain-free mobility, and jump-start the process of cultivating life-long energy through movement. I use the <a href="http://edge.affiliateshop.com/public/AIDLink?AID=99991&amp;BID=13491" target="_blank">Z-Health</a> exercise system to create a unique program for each client.&Acirc;  Want to give this method a try? Set up a <a href="/free-consult">free consult</a> today.</p>

<h3>Mobility Tailored to Your Needs</h3><br />
Over time, I found that little nagging issue would come up in our group classes that I couldn't address for two main reasons: 1) There were just too many people in the room and my students needed more individual attention than I could provide in a group setting 2) It wasn't always clear to me how the highly integrated movements of tai chi and qigong could be broken down to address a specific ache or pain. The methods are certainly there in these systems, but I didn't have the necessary training. So instead, I started training in Z-Health --- now I can provide tailored exercises for specific movement issues.</p>
