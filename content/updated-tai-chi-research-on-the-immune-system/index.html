<p>When many of us think of "immune system" problems we usually thing about conditions like HIV or AIDS, But our immune systems actually protect us from all opportunistic infections, from influenza to Ebola. When invaders enter the body they are sensed by the immune system, which then prepares the appropriate response to deal with the problem. Fevers and congestion are the bodies attempt to kill or expel the invaders. If this system of protection is not functioning efficiently the invaders enter easily and take hold. AIDS never killed anyone: The opportunistic infections that are allowed to run out of control because of a suppressed immune system are the real killers.</p>
<p>The problem with the immune system that if we do not take care of it the system will eventually become overloaded and function will begin to let invaders slip through. This happens in hospital frequently after surgeries because the immune system is intentionally suppressed and most post-surgical deaths are the result of infections. While there are drug therapies, like the AIDS cocktail that will help the immune system the best way to keep it strong it through proper diet and exercise. There is quite a bit of <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/01/04/how-to-learn-absolutely-anything-in-2012/">updated Tai Chi research on the immune system</a> out there though.</p>
<p>According to Michael Irwin, MD, a Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles' Semel Institute for Neuroscience new studies are showing that Tai Chi practice helps boost immune response. Dr. Irwin was part of a study conducted at the San Diego campus in which 112 healthy adults were tested. These test subjects were divided into two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group One practiced Tai Chi for three one hour classes each week.</li>
<li>Group Two took health education classes for the same periods.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Because age significantly lowers immune response the participants were all older adults, from 59-86 with an average age of 70 years. They were all injected with Varivax, a chicken pox vaccine. All of the patients had previously had chicken pox when younger so there was no risk. The immune system will react however and when the immune responses were tested in each group the <a href="http://dankleiman.com/videos/">Tai Chi students</a> were already showing better responses than the health class students after only 9 weeks of the 16 week study.</p>
<p>Tai Chi practice will improve your body's immune response and regular Tai Chi classes, with qualified teachers, will improve it quickly. A good Tai Chi class will have students feeling better within a month or so, whereas solo practice, which can be done, might take much longer.</p>
