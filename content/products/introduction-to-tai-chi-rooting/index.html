<p>In "An Introduction to Rooting and Stability," you will be introduced to the ancient Chinese method for gaining, or re-gaining, one of life's simplest yet most essential treasures--<em>the gift of balance</em>.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4820" alt="Rooting and Stability" src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CoverChop-300x231.jpg" width="300" height="231" />These Tai Chi Balance Exercises by themselves form a beginning program that will produce a noticeable improvement in your sense of being grounded, or connected to the earth, centrally stabilized around a vertical axis, and able to change visual orientation while remaining balanced.</p>
<p>As you practice these exercises, you will begin to feel and understand the essential Tai Chi concepts of Rooting, Central Equilibrium, and Dragon Body.</p>
<p>The exercises are drawn from the more than 45 separate exercises contained in the complete <a title="The Tai Chi Way to Better Balance" href="http://dankleiman.com/better-balance/">Tai Chi Way to Better Balance program</a>, which includes both an E-book and DVDs.<br />
