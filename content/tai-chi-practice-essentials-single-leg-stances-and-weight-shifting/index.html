<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4840" alt="images3" src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/images3.jpg" width="160" height="238" />When originally practiced in Northern China there were eight basic stances in tai chi. Time and a deeper understanding of the Art have narrowed the choices to only five. One image in many people's mind when they think of tai chi is of a student in a slight squat, arms circled around nothing. This particular stance is called the Horse-Riding Stance. This particular stance is one of the most basic of the <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/08/22/exploring-the-five-movement-centers">short form stances</a> and was often used by teachers to test obedience and sincerity in a particular student. The Stance, if done properly and in harmony, can actually be quite relaxing, but if done improperly can be quite uncomfortable, although not harmful. Once properly learned this stance builds leg strength and improves balance.</p>
<p>The Bow and Arrow Stance and Stretching Stance are also very much a part of form practice. These stances are the first stances that have a left and right form. Stretching Stance is a warm up stance and the bow and arrow stance teaches students how to maintain balance during transitioning movements and to keep the feet properly positioned. But before we can move into angles and twists we must first learn about weight distribution and weight shifting for better balance.</p>
<p>The last two stances, the Empty Leg Stance and the <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/07/26/the-connection-between-rooting-and-strength-in-tai-chi/">Single Leg Stance</a> give us the opportunity to find out bodies center.</p>
<ul>
<li>Begin by standing erect, feet at shoulder width and arms relaxed at your sides.</li>
<li>Focus your attention on your breathing until it calms and regulates.</li>
<li>Shift focus and find your bodies center.. Picture a golden line moving down through your body from the top of your head.</li>
<li>Slowly shift your center of gravity until it centers over your right leg.</li>
<li>Feel the weight leave your left leg empty of weight, become completely weightless, disconnected from your body.</li>
<li>Repeat the process on your other leg.</li>
<li>Lastly, <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/07/02/5-ways-to-build-stronger-legs-using-tai-chi-exercises/">raise one of your legs</a> until the knee is above the waist and maintain the position with your center of gravity, your Golden Line, moving from the top of your head in a straight line to the bottom of your weight bearing foot.</li><br />
</ul><br />
When you have finished this exercise you will have learned to find your center of gravity and control its direction, control the weight around your center of gravity and finally you  have learned how to use this to control your balance and transition from one stance, Empty Leg, to another stance, Single Leg..</p>
