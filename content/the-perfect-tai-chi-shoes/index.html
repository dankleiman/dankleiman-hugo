<p>As a teacher and practitioner, the only<strong> Tai Chi shoes</strong> I ever wear are these Vivo Barefoots (pictured on the right). They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight</li>
<li>Comfortable</li>
<li>Flexible</li>
<li>Thin enough to maintain sensitivity between my feet and the ground</li>
<li>Cushioned enough to prevent rocks from digging into my feet</li><br />
</ul><br />
Most importantly, they are designed to move with the natural wave of the foot when you walk, instead of inhibiting it like most modern shoes.</p>
<p><strong>90% of the movement problems I fix with my students could be prevented if they wore shoes that encouraged this healthy movement of the feet instead of ones that "lock" the feet down.</strong></p>
<p>When you click through the link below, you'll find men's and women's styles, training shoes, and even nicer ones to wear at work or more formal settings. The secret is the sole that gives you tons of freedom of movement.</p>

<p><strong>Wait!</strong> Before you click through to the Vivo Barefoot site, you should know that <em>they offer 30%-, 40%-, and 50%-off sales on a pretty regular basis</em>. If you sign up for my free email newsletter below, I'll send you a heads-up email when these shoes go on sale AND you'll get regular practice tips on Tai Chi, qigong, and designing a healthy movement practice.</p>
