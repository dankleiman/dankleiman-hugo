<p>Stability in most exercises is based on and comes directly from the legs. The position of the legs determine the expression of the movements and it is the legs that generate the energy, the power that turn the legs, and through them the body, into a spring, ready to pounce. One of the most important things that we do before we begin sets is to pay particular attention to the weight distribution between the legs. <a title="Empty Leg Practice for Balance, Stability, and Flow" href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/03/18/empty-leg-practice-for-balance-stability-and-flow/">In Tai Chi there are twin concepts of "empt and "full</a>". Beginning students learn these concepts very early in their studies by applying them to the legs.</p>

<p>The concept of empty legs and full legs relates to the weight distribution on each side of your body, beginning at the legs. When your body weight is on one leg, this leg is considered full, while the other leg is considered empty. This does not mean that all of the weight is on one leg however. The ratio is more like 70/30, full/empty. This deeper understanding of our body that we receive from Tai Chi is one of the main reasons that Tai Chi has become increasingly popular in <a title="Dr. Fuzhong Li's Tai Chi Research" href="http://dankleiman.com/dr-fuzhong-lis-tai-chi-research/">helping the elderly improve their balance and prevent falls</a>.</p>
<p>At least one study found that the effect of Tai Chi Chuan leg movement speed on leg muscle function, and found that the same benefits obtained by younger students is easily transferable to older students. All Tai Chi movements are circular in nature, which corresponds to the circular structure of the human body, allowing smooth, unbroken continuous movements and recognizing these circular patterns that they share with out bodies will help keep us stable from the ground up.</p>
<p>Tai Chi has very few kicks and no high spinning kicks like many of the martial arts but because of the initial stance training and the focus on the legs from the beginning, learning these styles, should students choose to do so, will become much easier after mastering form sets in Tai Chi. If you are interested not in auditioning for a Jackie Chan movie, you can use what you learn to improve your life and your health. Building a good base, a solid foundation, is essential to progressing in any health or exercise program and Tai Chi is no different in this respect.</p>
