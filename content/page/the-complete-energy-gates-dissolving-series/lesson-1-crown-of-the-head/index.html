In your first workout, give yourself plenty of time to settle in.</p>
<p>We'll use the crown of the head as an anchor point in future workouts as well: each time you stand, you'll return to this point as a way to focus the mind, gather your energy, and start the process of scanning down through the body.</p>
<p>Each week, I will send you a new workout via email. Let me know if you have any questions!</p>
