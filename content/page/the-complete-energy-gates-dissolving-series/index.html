<img class="size-medium wp-image-4994 " alt="Standing Qigong Audio Workouts" src="/uploads/2014/01/QigongAudioWorkouts-01-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /><p> The easiest way to work through the Energy Gates Dissolving Series - like having a teacher by your side the whole time!</p>
<p><strong>Over the next 21 weeks, you will do a complete pass through all of the major Energy Gates of your body.</strong></p>
<p>Week-by-week, as you clear the gates, you will find new space inside the body, release bound or stuck chi, and realign the twists, kinks, and compressions that warp the body -- physically and energetically.</p>
<p>By dissolving, you will also release your way into energetic still points -- the foundation of all advanced meditation practices.</p>
<p>Here is the order you will practice in:</p>
<p><span class="ez-boxtitle-black">Phase 1: Head, Neck, and Shoulders</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Crown of the Head</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Third Eye, the Eyes, the Center of the Ears, the Temples and the Four Jaw Points</strong></li>
<li><strong>Where the Tongue Touches the Roof of the Mouth and the Throat Notch</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Base of the Skull and the Cervical Vertebrae</strong></li>
<li><strong>Throat Channel from Roof of Mouth to Base of Sternum</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Four Gates of the Shoulder</strong></li><br />
</ol><br />
<span class="ez-boxtitle-black">Phase 2: Torso and Arms</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Elbows</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Wrists</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Hands</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Rib Cage</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Solar Plexus</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Whole Belly</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Lower Dantien</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Whole Spine</strong></li><br />
</ol><br />
<span class="ez-boxtitle-black">Phase 3: Lower Body</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Pelvis and Kwa</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Anus, Genitals, and Perineum</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Knees</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Ankles</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Feet</strong></li><br />
</ol><br />
<span class="ez-boxtitle-black">Phase 4: Energetic Completion</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Below the Floor</strong></li>
<li><strong>Above the Head</strong></li><br />
</ol></p>
<h2>Structured Practice Sessions</h2><br />
Now, you could set out to navigate all these phases by yourself, but structuring practice sessions, going in order for all the gates, and staying on track adds several layers of challenges beyond the basic one: Letting Go with Dissolving. </p>
<p>That's why, I'd like to offer you a structured practice series that you can follow along with to easily work your way through the entire Energy Gates Dissolving Series.</p>
<p>Each week, you will receive:</p>
<ul class="bullet-plus">
<li><strong>An audio download</strong> that will guide you through the practice of the week.</li>
<li><strong>Tips and tutorials</strong> on specific postures, alignments, and Dissolving concepts to work on.</li>
<li><strong>Direct email access</strong> to me to help you troubleshoot any issues that arise in your practice.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Normally, I teach this progression over <em>six months of weekly classes</em> ($210 x 3 = $630), in equivalent live workshops. I've spent 10 years refining the way I coach people through this process.</p>
<p>If you commit to regular weekly standing and let me guide you through the process, I'm confident that you too can find internal stillness from the Energy Gates Dissolving practice.</p>
<p>I've tried to make this distilled version of teaching affordable, accessible, and painless, so the emphasis is on your practice, in the moment, every time. You can enroll in the Energy Gates Dissolving Series for $39/month for the duration of the program and start your journey with weekly coaching emails and downloads.</p>
