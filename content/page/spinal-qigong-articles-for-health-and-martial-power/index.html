<p>The spine is the rack that the rest of the body hangs on and problems with the spine will always radiate out to the rest of the body and cause problems. Western medical experts have always had problems applying their paradigm (cut first, ask questions later) but have been recently recognizing the benefits of using Qigong to not only prevent injuries but to help correct existing injuries.</p>
<p>Fortunately, for those of us that do not read the New England Journal of Medicine while we are drinking our morning coffee, there are plenty of <b>spinal Qigong articles for health and martial power </b>on the internet and people with back and spine problems can get a better idea about how this programs can help build, or rebuild, a healthy spine.</p>
<p>One article <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/12/11/qigong-for-a-healthy-spine/">talks about</a>  working with each segment of the spine individually, working slowly inward to the <a href="http://dankleiman.com/spinal-qigong-exercises/">deeper structures</a> using Tai Chi meditation. It begins with the basics and moves into a step-by-step basic routine, with a short demonstration video. This article addresses subjects such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connecting to a natural source of power.</li>
<li>Structuring your practice for best effect.</li>
<li>Breaking through the daily noise in your mind so that you can focus.</li>
<li>Increasing your practice each week to build on your work.</li><br />
</ul><br />
New students of Qigong are able to quickly grasp the effectiveness of Qigong in improving spinal health. One of the first things new students learn is standing correctly and early exercises, like <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/11/12/bend-the-bow-spinal-qigong/">Bend the Bow</a>, begin the process of developing each segment of the vertebrae column by following <a href="http://www.energyarts.com/bend-bow-spinal-qigong">these steps</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loosens the spine</li>
<li>Relaxes the nervous system</li>
<li>Controlling the physical movements with intention and harmonizing them with your breathing.</li>
<li>Finally you are able to link together the physical and energetic movements of the organs with the nervous system that controls them.</li><br />
</ul><br />
While not always the case, especially with independent blogs, most of these articles are written by professional Qigong/Tai Chi instructors who use articles, videos, audio recordings and private classes so that students are able to learn in their own way, at their own speed. These virtual teachers often offer a great deal of material as a community service, to give people the chance to try the exercises before actually enrolling in classes. Spinal health should be one of our first concerns and using <b>spinal Qigong articles for health and martial power</b> improvement is proving a very effective course.</p>
