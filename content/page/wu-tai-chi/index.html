<p>Wu Tai Chi is a type of Tai Chi Ch'uan exercise that comes from China. Tai Chi is known as "moving meditation" because it uses slow, controlled movements to gain strength, balance and mental serenity. There are many schools of Tai Chi Ch'an exercise, and Wu Tai Chi is one of the oldest forms.<br />

<h2>Origins of Wu Tai Chi</h2><br />
This form of tai chi arose out of the traditional Chinese martial arts. Wu Jianquan learned special techniques of neutralizing the enemy's actions from his father. He continued to perfect these techniques, formalizing the movements. The Wu family held this knowledge within their family for many generations. They emphasized special areas of the training: <a title="The Transformational Power of Tai Chi Body Mechanics" href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/01/07/the-transformational-power-of-tai-chi-body-mechanics/">slowness, lightness, perseverance, stillness and precision</a>. After World War II, interest in many of the Asian martial arts increased in the western world and tai chi became popular, both as discipline and as a health regime.</p>

<h2>Principles of the Wu Style</h2><br />
Wu style tai chi emphasizes form that flows naturally through the joints in a calm movement. The breathing that accompanies movement is calm, steady and unrestrained. Movement and breathing should be in harmony. The movements must be smooth and without breaks, whether going backward, forward or sideways. The eyes should remain straight-ahead or looking at the hands. Balance and equilibrium is maintained at all times. After a long period of exercise, a state of intense concentration can be achieved.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Tai Chi</h2><br />
Though its roots are in the martial arts, tai chi is recognized to promote health. The exercises are low impact and do not harm joints. This feature can be particularly important to seniors or anyone who has an existing joint injury. The exercises also include gentle stretching, muscle flexibility, breathing improvement and promotion of good balance. Exercises can be adapted to individual needs. Tai chi also promotes self-awareness, concentration and inner calm, <a title="Tai Chi's Most Powerful Technique" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/11/06/tai-chi-most-powerful-technique/">which can help in today's stressful world</a>.

<h2>Who Can Do Wu Style Tai Chi?</h2><br />
One of the most important features of tai chi exercise is that it can be done by people of any age or any physical condition. You can engage the entire family in tai chi, from the youngest children to elders without danger of taxing muscles or bones too strenuously. It aids youngsters with balance for other sports activities and helps older people with flexibility and muscle strength. Other adults can benefit from tai chi's ability to help with stress and improving energy levels.</p>
