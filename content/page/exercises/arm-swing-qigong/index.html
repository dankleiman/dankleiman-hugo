<p>As an ancient art of healing, Qigong is excellent for restoring the body's ability to re-establishing vital energy, also known as Qi. Pain, fatigue, mood, disease and overall quality of life can be reversed, according to this Chinese philosophy. Qigong has different methods to achieve results.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Arm Swing Qigong</strong></p>
<p>One method of Qigong is Arm Swing Qigong. This method is also good for the heart, for the arms are thought to be extensions of the heart. Anxiety, mental and emotional problems and even insomnia and over-excitement are relieved with this method.</p>
<p><strong>Swaying Hands One</strong></p>
<p>Standing up straight with a vertical line pictured running up the center of your body, begin to twist your waist from side to side. Allow the arms to swing along with the body. Do not use your arm muscles to keep the hands from touching the body as the arms swing in front and behind you. Simply allow the hands to touch the body as this happens. Keep the knees stationary. All the organs in the body are being massaged at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Swaying Hands Two</strong></p>
<p>Next, standing up straight, make a single bounce by bending the knees and then straightening them. The arms should swing forward up when knees are bent, and down when knees are straight. Inhale when arms are up, and exhale when arms are down. Do not take deep breaths so you don't hyperventilate. Next, do a double bounce moving the arms up and down again.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative Method for Exercise Two</strong></p>
<p>Arm Swing Qigong bounce can be done a different way. Instead of bending the knees and straightening them to bounce, keep legs straight and lift heels while arms swing up. Inhale through nose. When heels go down along with the arms, exhale through mouth. Do not tighten up or tense your muscles. Make this as easy as possible. Have fun with it.</p>
<h2>Learn the 3 Swings</h2><br />
Similar to the Swaying methods described above, <a title="Three Swings from Opening the Energy Gates Qigong" href="http://dankleiman.com/exercises/three-swings-from-opening-the-energy-gates-qigong/">the 3 Swings from Opening the Energy Gates</a> are designed to build your energy up, using the connection of the legs to the earth.</p>

<p>You can see that the more complex footwork changes the pattern of the swinging arms, creating different pulls through the body and activating higher energy centers as you progress through the set.</p>
