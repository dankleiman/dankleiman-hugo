<p>The main practice is a walking exercises where you focus on moving up and down the yin and yang meridians of your legs with your feeling awareness. Eventually, you begin to feel beyond your feet into the earth and deeper into your center, allowing you to really connect your energy to the ground.</p>
<p>See if you can get a hang of the physical movements, the way the bend and stretch coordinate with the weight shifts, and finally, find a place where the movement of your mind/energy up and down feels like it leads the physical movements.</p>
