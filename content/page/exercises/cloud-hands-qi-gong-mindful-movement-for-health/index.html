Your feet should be parallel with a U-shape between your legs. Arms should be to your side. Breathing is abdominal. Your tongue should be on the roof of your mouth. Swallow saliva that may form with one clump.</p>
<p>Lift your left arm up vertically. As you raise your arm slowly, follow the extended hand with your eyes as it rises to the height of your shoulders. Fingers should be apart, not too loosely and not tight. It is important that both your mind and body partake in the movement.</p>
<p>Turn extended arm slowly as it sinks downward. Simultaneously, begin lifting right arm slowly. Where hands would meet in the front, the palms will face each other, both arms turning over half way.</p>
