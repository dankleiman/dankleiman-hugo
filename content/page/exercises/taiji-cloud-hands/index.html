<p>Taiji Cloud Hands movement is among the commonly used forms as either a static set of postures or a dynamic movement. Beginners to the cloud Hands movement are best served with a focus on the gross movements. More advanced students will refine the nuance of hand motions, spinal alignment, and breathing based on the emphasis of different internal skills.</p>
<p>Cloud Hands is a basic and integral movement for any Taiji practice. The student will gain several benefits. Learn more about the benefits and a few tips for easy practice. As with all Taiji forms, it is best to first learn from an instructor either in person or through video.</p>

<p>In the video above, <a title="Tai Chi Instructor Robert Tangora" href="http://dankleiman.com/robert-tangora-tai-chi/">Taiji instructor Robert Tangora</a> demonstrates some variations of Cloud Hands, done in different styles.</p>
<h2>The Purpose of Taiji Cloud Hands</h2><br />
Every movement in Taiji has set of distinct purposes along with the general benefits of the art. Cloud Hands helps to isolate the back muscles through turns at the waist, which relaxes the neck and shoulders by increasing flow of blood and chi. One benefit is the increase in coordination and strength of back muscles. Learning to isolate these muscles is an important part of reducing the risk of injury in daily life.</p>
<p>A specific health benefit of the motion is seen in the student's relief from insomnia and chronic stress. The neck region becomes a storehouse of stress in the modern world. As the neck tightens, the jaw follows and this prevents the free flow of blood and chi to the crown and back down the Functional Channel. Any disharmonies present in the meridians are made worse by this loss of flow. Taiji Cloud Hands increases the flow for a more harmonious being.</p>
<p>In this in-depth interview, <a title="Robert Tangora Tai Chi Cloud Hands Interview" href="http://dankleiman.com/robert-tangora-tai-chi-cloud-hands-interview/">Robert Tangora explains the power of Cloud Hands to integrate your mind, body, and chi</a>.</p>
<h2>Tips for Beginner Practice</h2><br />
The art of Taiji is not mastered in a few group session. Like any set of skills, it requires daily practice punctuated by proper instruction. No short-cuts to mastery exist, but beginners may benefit from some general and specific tips.</p>
<p>There is no rush with Taiji. A faster motion without the nuance is not beneficial. Each students needs the time to slowly work through motions. Focus on one aspect at a time, beginning with the gross movement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exhale on a left turn and inhale on a right turn until breathing becomes the smooth, not forced.</li>
<li>Hands should always follow the waist. Practice the form free style in this manner.</li>
<li>The elbow of the top arm always points to the direction of turn, but has the sense of dropping to the floor.</li>
<li>Taiji Cloud Hands should appear like imaginary, rounded rectangles in the air.</li><br />
