<p>Doing ankle circles like the ones in this video are a sure-fire way to disrupt the stress cycle where "the brain eats the body". By focusing on the sensations in the ankles, your chi will naturally drop out of your head and back down into the body. This technique is especially good for times you can't sleep. Do 100 ankle rotations in each direction.....bet you won't get to 100!<br />
