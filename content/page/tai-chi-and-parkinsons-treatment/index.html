<p>The New England Journal of Medicine recently reported on a <a href="http://www.johnshopkinshealthalerts.com/reports/healthy_living/376-1.html">study conducted</a> by Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (one of the world&acute;s top medical research hospitals) that found direct benefits from practicing Tai Chi in the prevention and treatment of Parkinson&acute;s Disease. While the study has yet to be subjected to peer review, the results are impressive enough that if they are confirmed it could radically change treatment paradigms for this, and several other conditions, like Multiple Sclerosis.</p>
<p>According to researchers on the study in some cases the results from patients using Tai Chi were better than those of patients using traditional medication. The reason for this is that the exercises are designed to improve <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/03/18/empty-leg-practice-for-balance-stability-and-flow/">stability, balance and flexibility</a>. Parkinson&acute;s Disease is caused by the degradation of the brain cells that make dopamine. It is dopamine that carries messages to muscle cells that guide muscle movement. This slow loss of dopamine to muscle cells gradually make the muscles stiff, the stance unbalanced and shaky and getting muscles moving will be more difficult.  The medications currently being used work moderately well in controlling the tremors patients suffer but do little to relieve the axial symptoms of Parkinson's.</p>
<p>The study was composed 195 patients in three test groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tai Chi sets</li>
<li>Weight lifting</li>
<li>Seated stretching</li><br />
</ul><br />
The groups med for 60-minute sessions, two sessions per week and after the first six-months of the study the Tai Chi students were able lean further forward and backward compared to either of the other groups. Their movements were smoother and they were able to take much larger steps. They were even able to walk more swiftly and get up from a chair more efficiently. Finally, Tai Chi actively prevents falls, the main cause of hospitalization in Parkinson&acute;s cases and cut the number and frequency of falls in half.</p>
<p>Tai Chi in Parkinson&acute;s treatment is taught by qualified <a href="http://dankleiman.com/products/">Tai Chi Chuan instructors</a>. Once the students get a solid grasp of the fundamentals they will be able to work alone but should still continue classes. There are more advanced aspects, such as Push Hands exercises that require two people working together. Simple Push Hands exercises build muscle strength while forcing students to focus on balance, stability and the movement of energy between the two students, teaches students to make a well understood friend of gravity, further protecting them from injury.</p>
