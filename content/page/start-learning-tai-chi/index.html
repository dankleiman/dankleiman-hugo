<p>The best way to <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/02/10/the-how-what-and-why-of-tai-chi-practice/">start learning Tai Chi</a> is to begin at the beginning. There are three very basic things that are essential if you are to get everything that you can from your practice. You must learn how to focus, stilling your mind, using this focus to find your Kwa and using abdominal breathing to manipulate the energy channels throughout your body. Unlike most fitness programs Tai Chi places the mind ahead of the body.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Begin with the following steps.</b></p></p>
<ul>
<li>Our eyes, or to be exact, the things that pass before <a href="/dankleiman.com/2012/06/04/relaxing-your-eyes-in-tai-chi/">our eyes</a>, can be very distracting. Once you have achieved a relaxed standing position, arms and shoulders relaxed, feet at shoulder width, relax the eyes. Disregard what is passing before you and focus on the eyes themselves. See the weight, the tension, in the eyes flow down through the body.</li>
<li>The next step is to find the kwa. and you other basic leg alignments. Without a clear sense for how you are connected to the ground, you can't do much in Tai Chi. The Classics say, "the movements are powered by the legs, steered by the waist, and expressed in the hands." The first step to unifying the legs, waist and spine is to <a href="/dankleiman.com/2012/01/23/learning-to-use-your-kwa-in-tai-chi/">learn how to use your kwa.</a></li>
<li>Finally you will need to change the way that you breathe. Most <a href="/dankleiman.com/exercises/basic-abdominal-breathing-exercises/">people draw breath</a> into their lungs by trying to expand the chest and while this will keep you alive this shallow type of breathing isn't optimal. Once you are able to activate the diaphragm instead of the chest, you will begin to have a more relaxed, natural breath.</li><br />
</ul><br />
The final step is designed to allow you to become reacquainted with your body. You can then use a powerful neigong technique that increases internal awareness. Learn how to simply stand, properly of course, for at least 15 minutes each day. This technique helps develop the Chi in your body and increases your internal awareness allowing you to sense the places where the Chi is blocked.</p>
<p>The name "Tai Chi" simply means "Supreme Ultimate" and the practice of the art should not be confused with any religion, Eastern or otherwise. In China many Buddhists and Taoists practice Tai Chi but not everyone who practices is Buddhist or Taoist. The art has been used in China for thousands of years as basically a health and fitness routine, much like calisthenics and palates are in the West. New students should <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/12/14/9-different-ways-to-think-about-tai-chi/">think about Tai Chi</a> and relevant arts as a  simple set of exercises that approach your health from a whole body, and mind, perspective.</p>
