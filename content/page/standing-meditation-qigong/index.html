<p>Standing meditation Qigong, also known as Chi Kung or Chi Gung, is one of many types of Qigong that originated in China approximately 4,000 years ago. Practiced by Chinese medical practitioners, martial arts enthusiasts and philosophers, the tradition involves adopting a pose of physical stillness while calming the mind and activating the flow of chi throughout the body. While some consider the art a form of exercise, others use the activity as an alternative healing medicine or purely for meditative purposes.</p>
<h2>Purpose of Qigong</h2><br />
Taoists believe that standing meditation Qigong cultivates the mind, body and spirit. By learning how to clear the mind, Taoists believe that individuals eventually acquire the skill of moving chi to different body locations, which provides physical endurance, health and strength along with encouraging the growth of virtue. Individuals practicing this static training form of Qigong maintain a particular pose for a specific length of time. Initially, the pose may last a few minutes, with training and experience, practitioners boast remaining in the same position for days.</p>
<h2>Practicing Standing Meditation</h2><br />

<p>A fundamental pose requires standing with feet parallel and shoulder width apart or with feet slightly closer together. Toes point forward. Tuck the pelvis forward slightly, which straightens the curve of the lower spine. The shoulders should remain relaxed with arms extended down the length of the sides. With the hands relaxed, fingers extend. The palms may face the thighs or face backward with thumbs touching the thighs. Hold the head erect and close the eyes or focus on an object straight ahead. While holding a particular pose, individuals practice clearing the mind by concentrating on inhaling and exhaling, releasing discomfort and stress from the body and redirecting chi.</p>
