<p>One of the biggest problems in today's technological world is <a title="How to Treat Lower Back Pain" href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/07/06/how-to-treat-lower-back-pain/">lower back problems</a>. Because so many people spend a good part of their day sedentary, either sitting down or humped over an LCD screen. The posture that eventually develops can get severe enough to actually cause breathing problems because it not only interferes with the circulation of blood, but also the circulation of the body's energy by corrupting the integrity of the spine. The best way to correct and avoid this potentially crippling problem is to get to know the spine by doing spine lengthening exercises on a regular basis.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_1hMPWIbTiY?rel=0" height="315" width="560" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The above video is an excellent walk through of the process. The body and its systems are a whole, with each depending on the other and the spine is the communication network for all of them. The body's energies come from its connection to the earth and is channeled through the feet and legs into the spine and throughout the body. When the spine stretching exercise begins it draws this energy from the legs into the spine, making the connection between the Earth and the body.</p>
<p>Once the legs and spine are connected we can begin the process of releasing the tensions and blockages in our spine, beginning with the sacroiliac and moving into the lumbar spine, one segment at a time. The lower spine is composed of four coccygeal and five sacral bones (fused to create one bone called the sacrum). Because this is such an important connection point special attention needs to be taken here.</p>
<p>The next section, the lumbar spine, requires special attention as well because most lower back problems originate in this area, mostly because of poor posture. When these verterbrae are separated in the spine stretch, the entire bound up energy is released back into the body's organs and systems. The top of the lumbar spine is also directly across from the dantien, the central gathering point for the body's energy. There are five vertebrae in the lumbar section of the spine.</p>
<p>There are twelve thoracic vertebrae and these segments support the spines two weakest points, the lumber and cervical vertebrae. The thoracic vertebrae are like a central nexus, a thick trunk, which the body needs to talk to its various parts. Finally, there are seven cervical vertebrae and these seven vertebrae are certainly the weakest part of the spine and arguably the weakest part of the body. They are consequently most likely to develop problems early.</p>
<p>When you move though the various stages of the spine lengthening exercise you can actually feel the energy as it releases in each section. When the spine begins to readjust to its natural state your breathing becomes easier, your tensions seem to melt away and you seem filled with energy.</p>
