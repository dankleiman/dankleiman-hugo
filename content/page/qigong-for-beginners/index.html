<p><a href="/uploads/2013/06/index.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4666" style="margin: 8px 2px;" alt="index" src="/uploads/2013/06/index-150x150.jpg" width="239" height="239" /></a>When many people see people engaged in Qigong exercises the movements appear both smooth and effortless, while at the same time they seem incredibly complex. When these same people begin training and discover that the purpose of Qigong training is to manipulate the Qi meridians it seems impossible to understand. When we gain control of these meridians however we are enhancing the vital life forces that are constantly moving through our bodies. While it seems extremely difficult to reach such a state without decades of hard work, the fact is that it is really no more difficult than climbing a staircase.</p>
<p>The problem for most Westerners is one of perception. We have been taught that our bodies are mechanical structures with a "soul". The soul however, what it is, where it is, and what it does, is seldom explained in any rational terms. We are simply told of its existence. Practitioners of movement arts such as Tai Chi, Qigong and Yoga however learn about the soul, and its various levels. One of the first things learned is about the presence of the "Chi". The Chi is not the soul/ Instead, it is the energy that not only powers the body, but, but that which connects the body to the soul, to our essential selves.</p>
<p>We can access this energy source by practicing simple breathing, meditation and movement exercises so that we can access the Chi. Actually, beginners will find that it is not all that complicated to procure great benefits from their Qi Gong training. Simple breathing, posture and meditation exercises can be used quite effectively to boost Qi flow. Now, this is not to say no effort or skill is required to cultivate the energy through basic Qi Gong exercises. Qi Gong cultivation is a learned skill. However, as long as beginners have a basic idea of where and how to start their Qi Gong training, they can make great progress right from the beginning. This could lead them down a lifelong path of better and healthier living.</p>
<p>For the beginner, it is always best to stick with very basic, simple movements and exercises. During the early stages of Qi Gong training, it is necessary to just get a basic feel for the exercises. Qigong training begins with certain basic beginner movements. We begin with learning how to breathe properly, move toward proper posture and then into movements, learning how to harmonize each aspect as we progress. The biggest mistake many new students make is to try to learn as many movements as possible in the beginning with no thought to proper breathing or posture. The problem is that our posture affects our breathing, among other things, and our breathing functions to move the energy throughout our body. We must do things in order.</p>
<p>Try this:</p>

Or try this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Begin your breathing exercises by establishing correct posture.</li>
<li>Stand erect but relaxed, arms hanging at your sides, feet shoulder width apart.</li>
<li>Sink the chest inward and slowly draw a breath from the abdomen.</li>
<li>Do not hold your breath. When you have reached your comfortable limit of breath, slowly release it.</li><br />
</ul><br />
These two simple exercises, establishing proper breathing and posture, will lay the ground work for you to move into movements. Now that the foundation has been well laid, you are able to move into advanced practices and gain the full benefit.<br />
