<p><a href="/uploads/2013/04/10maytaichimeditation.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4545" style="margin: 8px 2px" alt="10maytaichimeditation" src="/uploads/2013/04/10maytaichimeditation-150x150.jpg" width="114" height="114" /></a>The practice of meditation, even in the west, is hardly new. Not only is meditation used in most religions (prayer is a form of meditation), but many athletes also use it regularly, before, during and after events. In today&acute;s fast paced business world many corporations put time aside during the work day for employees to use mediation and movement arts routines and have found that this small expenditure of time improves productivity a great deal.<br />
Taoist mediation is being used more and more frequently in many different settings because of the effect that it has on the <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/11/06/tai-chi-most-powerful-technique/" target="_blank">central nervous system</a>. As we move through our days both physical and emotional stress slowly builds throughout our bodies. Filling your body with adrenalin or endorphins relieves the symptoms, sometimes, but never addresses the cause. Regular Taoist meditation attacks the problems at their root by teaching students to <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/01/15/common-sensations-that-arise-when-you-are-developing-chi/" target="_blank">recognize their chi sensations</a>. The following is an example of the process:<br />
<a href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/01/29/3-layers-of-neigong-practice-and-taoist-meditation-with-paul-cavel/">Stages of Tai Chi Meditation</a><br />
&bull; In some cases students will need to begin with sitting meditation. This involves sitting erect, smoothing breathing patterns and calming the mind.<br />
&bull; The student should move slowly into a standing position, erect but relaxed, arms at sides and shoulders relaxed feet shoulder-width apart.<br />
&bull; New students will more than likely have to regain focus after moving into a standing position. There is no rush however. The object is to harmonize thought with action.<br />
&bull; When focus and harmony are again regained students can begin moving through the set.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember about the practice of Tai Chi and Tai Chi meditation is that they are inseparable, meditation through movement and movement through mediation. While it is possible to get benefit from practicing one or the other, the benefits will be limited. It is only when done with proper intent that the movements achieve their full effects.<br />
A few things about "intent", a term that is thrown about loosely, but that is rarely fully understood that you should know. The concept is rather simple though. Intent is simply focused desire. The movement arts are designed to bring your body into focus in every possible position while your attention (Mind: intent=desire + action), follows the movement. Taoist meditation then is the whole package, bringing the body into harmony with the mind through practices movement that brings the body/breath/mind into harmony.</p>
