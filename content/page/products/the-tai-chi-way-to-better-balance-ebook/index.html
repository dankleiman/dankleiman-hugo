<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">What's Inside the eBook?</span></h1><br />
Unlike other Tai Chi books, where you get over-dense text or photographs in confusing sequences, The Tai Chi Way to Better Balance uses:</p>
<ul class="bullet-arrow1">
<li><strong>Step-by-step IMAGES &amp; INSTRUCTIONS for each exercise.</strong></li><br />
</ul><br />
<img class="size-medium wp-image-4827" title="Tai Chi Walking" alt="Tai Chi Walking" src="/uploads/2013/08/Pag50-300x231.jpg" width="300" height="231" /> Detailed image/text combinations like this one on Tai Chi Walking take you step-by-step through each exercise.</p>
<ul class="bullet-arrow1">
<li><strong>ILLUSTRATIONS that simplify abstract concepts.</strong></li><br />
</ul><br />
<img class="size-medium wp-image-4828 " alt="Five Movement Centers" src="/uploads/2013/08/Pag37-300x231.jpg" width="300" height="231" /> Almost invisible to the untrained eye, yet essential for balancing the upper and lower body in motion, the Five Movement Centers create fluid stability.</p>
<ul class="bullet-arrow1">
<li><strong>Beautiful MASTER photos that capture the essence of Tai Chi.</strong></li><br />
</ul><br />
<img class="size-medium wp-image-4832" alt="Yin &amp; Yang" src="/uploads/2013/08/Page9-300x231.jpg" width="300" height="231" /> Hong Yijiao, demonstrating Yin and Yang qualities in two postures from Chen Tai Chi: the first coiled and sensitive, the second expansive and powerful.</p>

<div class="simple-grey-box" style="width: 70%; margin: 5px auto 20px;">
<p><em>First go through, I LOVE this book!! It's so clear to read on my Kindle that allows me to see it frame by frame in a way that really shows the flow. For example, visually the fonts, colors and highlighting techniques like the bullets, boxes and the curved lines at new chapters, as well as the rectangle that carries through gives punch and clarity. This is balanced by the beautiful old photos of both objects and people that make it feel less like an ebook. I found photos like the tree, people practicing outside, and dance-like figures a delight to look at.The "regular looking" people make me hopeful that I, too, can do this and the colorful demonstrations that explain poses are really helpful! Just even the expression of the woman on the last page captured the feel that I imagine I will have at the end of a practice session!</em> -- Nancy<br />
<em><br />
Remarkable exercises. This fulfills the promises that induced us to take up Tai Chi in the first place. No matter what your level is, whether you've even heard of Tai Chi, by following these simple exercises, you will benefit. If I were to tell you the effects of one seminar with Don Miller, you wouldn't believe me, so, see for yourself. Finally someone who has rediscovered Tai Chi's secrets, has the competence and the generosity to reveal them.</em> -- Ted</p>
<p><em>There is nothing like stagnate form practice in Don's Tai Chi. I was fortunate enough to study with Don for a year while on East Coast and he adds great depth to any form you may be trained in.</em> -- Lew</p>
<p><em>I ordered it and it is great. In the e-book are presented some great exercises and I can't recommend it enough. I can't wait to receive the DVD (by post mail). Thanks Dan Kleiman and Don Ethan Miller for this great program. Everybody interested in Tai Chi, other Internal Martial Arts or that wants to enhance his own balance must have it. I practiced some of the exercises presented in this program before and I can atest that they work. With this program you will take your Tai Chi in another lever and you will feel the difference. Also Don seems to really understand what Tai Chi is really about and how to develop combat skills. Can't wait for the sequel to this program. </em> -- Igor</p>
