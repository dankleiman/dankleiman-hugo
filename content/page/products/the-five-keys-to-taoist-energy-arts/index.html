If I had to put together a complete foundational program for learning qigong or Tai Chi, this is exactly what I'd include.</strong></p>
<p>What's inside the Five Keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breathing</li>
<li>Energy Work</li>
<li>Standing Meditation</li>
<li>Smooth Circular Movement.</li><br />
</ul><br />
In short, all the foundations for a great qigong program!</p>
<p>As you know from many episodes of Qigong Radio, I turn to Paul whenever I want a clear and structured explanation of a dimension of my practice (check out these episodes on <a title="Qigong Radio Episode 2: Developing Your Soft Tissue with Paul Cavel" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/03/29/qigong-radio-episode-2-developing-your-soft-tissue-with-paul-cavel/">body development</a> and <a title="3 Layers of Neigong Practice and Taoist Meditation with Paul Cavel" href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/01/29/3-layers-of-neigong-practice-and-taoist-meditation-with-paul-cavel/">meditation</a>).</p>
<p><em>You will be able to build every dimension of a complete qigong practice &mdash; pretty much all of which you can practice in 15-20 minute sessions.</em></p>
<p>I've checked out the first couple of lessons and I can tell you that they are excellent &mdash; straightforward, deep, and focused &mdash; like we always expect from Paul.</p>
<p>The best part of this online course format is that Paul will be available to answer questions in a private forum for the training group (which is why it's only open for a limited time &mdash; so that everyone can start and be on the same lessons together).</p>
<p>So, if you've been waiting for a chance to get started with qigong, no matter where you live or what background you bring to the practice, don't miss this opportunity.</p>
<p>And for experienced practitioners, Paul's clarity of teaching is sure to be an excellent upgrade.</p>
