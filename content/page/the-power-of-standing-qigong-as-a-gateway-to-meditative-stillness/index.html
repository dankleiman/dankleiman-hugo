<p>Standing Qigong is a gentle, yet powerful way to cultivate your internal energy. From the ancient Chinese point of view, <strong>an abundance of internal energy, that circulates cleanly throughout your body,</strong> leads to a vibrant life.</p>
<p>When you practice Standing Qigong, you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slow down your anxious, racing mind.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Discover internal sensations other than contraction, tension, and pain.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Clear out stagnant chi.</strong></li><br />
</ul><br />
You also open the doorway to deeper meditative states.</p>
<p>The potential for renewal, wholeness, and a feeling of integration that stays with you throughout the day is huge, <em>but only if you practice correctly </em>(incorrect practice can lead to increased levels of mental tension and physical exhaustion, or even injury and burnout).</p>
<p>To reap the most benefit from your Standing Qigong practice, and move towards the subtle realms of meditation, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn to relax the mind as well as the body.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Observe the limits of focus, concentration, and your own nervous system.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Let go of energetic blockages without fighting them or trying to control them.</strong></li><br />
</ul><br />
For most of us, this means approaching the mind-body link in Standing Qigong gradually, with heightened sensitivity to physical alignment, energetic flows, and the movement of the mind.</p>

To help you access Standing Qigong in a structured, safe way, I've created <strong>a free practice series</strong> delivered to you via bi-weekly emails.</p>
<p>When you sign up for the series, you'll learn about: <strong>correct standing posture, the role of the mind, the stages of relaxing, sinking chi, and ultimately how to dissolve stagnant energy</strong>, creating strong, healthy circulation patterns.</p>
<p>Twice a week for the next month, you will receive an email that includes:</p>
<ul class="bullet-arrow1">
<li>Step-by-step audio practice mp3s.</li>

</ul><br />
These are the same lessons I use when I teach Standing Qigong in weekly classes or live workshops. Now, you can practice them from home. All you need is access to your inbox and a place to save the mp3 audio files. It will be like having a qigong coach by your side!</p>
