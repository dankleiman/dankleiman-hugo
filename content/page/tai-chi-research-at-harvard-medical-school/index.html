<p>Have you ever seen someone in a park doing what looks like Kung Fu in slow motion? If you have you are already familiar with Tai Chi. Tai Chi is a traditional internally focused Chinese martial art that, while it is considered a self-defense system, is primarily practiced for the purpose of improving health and longevity.</p>
<p>Historically there have been claims of Tai Chi practitioners developing near supernatural powers. Modern Tai Chi research at Harvard Medical School has confirmed that the art can provide substantial health benefits, but unfortunately Tai Chi research has yet to establish evidence of any supernatural abilities associated with the practice.</p>
<p>Tai Chi can improve health in several ways.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strength:</strong> You wouldn't think that a slow moving, low impact activity like Tai Chi would build strength, but the basis of Tai Chi movement is the shifting of body weight from one leg to another. This makes for a great lower body work out.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong>  Practicing Tai Chi involves muscle stretching and movements that are great for loosening up stiff joints and improving overall flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Concentration:</strong> Tai Chi is essentially a moving meditation.  It requires a level of concentration beyond that required for many other forms of exercise.</li>
<li><strong>Stress reduction:</strong>  One of the most important aspects of Tai Chi is that when properly performed the body is completely relaxed. Spending a brief period of time each day enjoying some exercise with a clear mind and a relaxed body is an ideal way to reduce stress.</li>
<li><strong>Balance:</strong> Because Tai Chi is made up of movements based on the shifting of body weight from one leg to the other it is great for improving balance. Studies show that this improved balance is an excellent way for seniors to reduce the risk of fall related injuries.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Ongoing Tai Chi research at Harvard Medical School is looking into the cardiovascular and bone health benefits of the practice. Initial data suggest that practicing Tai Chi may reduce the risk of heart disease and improve bone density in post-menopausal women. Although it is important to note that studying the effects of Tai Chi is not as straight forward as most medical research so determining exactly how much it can benefit health and in what ways is difficult.</p>
<p><a title="Living between the Lab and the Classroom with Dr. Peter Wayne" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/01/11/living-between-the-lab-and-the-classroom-with-dr-peter-wayne/">In this interview, Harvard Medical Schoolprofessor Dr. Peter Wayne discusses the challenges of doing Tai Chi research.</a></p>
<p>Whether or not Tai Chi research ever completely establishes the extent of these health benefits it is clear that practicing the art does provide a positive impact on overall health. So regardless of your age or athletic ability Tai Chi might be a great way for you to improve your health.</p>
