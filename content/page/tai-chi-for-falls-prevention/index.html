<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4770" alt="AWHmain" src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/AWHmain-300x174.jpg" width="300" height="174" />Everyone falls at one time or another and, as we age, the possibility of losing our balance and falling victim to an injury causing fall increases. The fact is that even something small like wax buildup in our ears can cause problems balancing and disorders such as Parkinson &rsquo;s disease and osteoporosis. The Western medical community has many treatments for the diseases themselves but when a person falls, especially an elderly person, that person loses confidence in their ability to not fall. This mindset is never addressed in Western ttherapeutic environments.</p>
<p>One of the most important things addressed when a person begins tai chi is confidence. The movements are deliberately slow, allowing the student to follow each movement carefully and perfect it before going on to the next movement. Students are also taught to focus on what they are doing in a <a href="http://dankleiman.com/dragon-scans-the-horizon/">very detailed way</a>, again increasing confidence. Over time confidence will begin to grow as the exercises begin to make changes in the body:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leg strength increases</li>
<li>Balance improves significantly</li>
<li>Flexibility and mobility begin to improve</li>
<li>Psychological problems like depression and anxiety begin to d isappear</li>
<li>Fear of falling begins to decrease</li><br />
</ul><br />
There have been numerous studies on the effect of depression and/or anxiety general health. Depression can lead to cardiovascular problems like rapid heartbeat and high blood pressure and as the conditions progress victims begin to have a much harder time focusing. When the health begins to decline depression increases, and the effects begin to snowball.</p>
<p>When we practice tai chi the combination of harmonized breathing and movements with <a href="http://dankleiman.com/asymmetrical-weight-hold/%20and%20http:/dankleiman.com/wu-chi/">increased focus</a> begins to realign the body and energy begins to flow to challenged systems and  begin the healing process. The more time we spend practicing the better our health is and the less problems we have with falling. In time tai chi practice will actually change the way that we walk and stand.</p>
<p>Falls can be a disaster at any age, especially in older people. In younger people a broken bone can cause two or more months of lost wages but in older patients it can forced them into the house for fear of falling and this inactivity can lead to even faster deterioration.  The Center for Disease control has already released a set of guidelines for using tai chi in falls prevention and there are many hospitals and clinics around North America that are using tai chi in a therapeutic setting with amazing results.</p>
