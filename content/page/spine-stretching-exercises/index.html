<p>We have all seen long distance runners, gymnasts and weight lifters go through stretching routines before they begin their exercises. These stretching exercises help prevent injuries from the exercises themselves, loosen the muscles to allow them to move freely and increase blood flow to the entire body. While there are more sophisticated <a title="Spinal Qigong Articles for Health and Martial Power" href="http://dankleiman.com/spinal-qigong-articles-for-health-and-martial-power/">qigong techniques for stretching the spine</a>, here are some rules to follow before engaging in any stretching:</p>
<p>&bull; Wear loose comfortable clothing.<br />
&bull; Do all movement slowly, smoothly and continuously.<br />
&bull; Stop any movement at the range that is painful or uncomfortable.<br />
&bull; Stay within your comfort range. Begin with only 70% of your movement and gra dually increase the range.<br />
&bull; Stretch both sides of the body.</p>
<p>Before starting a stretching routine you should walk around, gently shaking your legs and arms, clench and unclench your fists to loosen the joints. From a Tai Chi perspective these movements will begin the process of unblocking your vital energy pathways.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2013/05/trunk-side-stretch_500_copyright.gif"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4589" alt="trunk-side-stretch_500_copyright" src="/uploads/2013/05/trunk-side-stretch_500_copyright-150x150.gif" width="150" height="150" /></a>There are six parts of the body that should be stretched before exercising. The neck, shoulders, spine, hips, knees and ankles but the most important area is of course the spine. The spine is not only the frame that the rest of our body hangs on; it is the central pathway for our internal energies. If these energies nodes are left blocked when we are training, at the very least we will not receive full benefit and at worse, suffer serious injury.</p>
<p>Beginning in the standard position, feet shoulder width apart, arms and shoulders relaxed.</p>
<p>&bull; Lean your head backward, inhaling as you do, and bring both hands above your head slowly. Turn your palms to point your fingers upward, then bring them down to your chest, pushing your chin backwards gently. Do not force any part of this.<br />
&bull; When you are ready to exhale, push both hands outward from the chest to your front and then, again slowly, press your hands down and bring your chin to your chest.<br />
&bull; Raise one hand, keeping the other in place at your side and look at your palm. Move the hand to your side and turn your head to look at your palm. Repeat this process for both hands.</p>
<p>These few simple stretching exercises will begin <a href="http://dankleiman.com/spinal-qigong-exercises/">the process of stretching your spine</a> and the attached structures. When combined with proper breathing and the slow movements of Tai Chi you will find yourself with increased energy and improving health.</p>
