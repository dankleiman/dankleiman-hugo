<p><strong>Learn the Tai Chi secrets of slow-motion movement that will re-educate your body.</strong></p>
<p>Our bodies close down over time, through injury, aging, and just general dis-use. When it comes to your body, the old cliche, <strong><em>move it or lose it </em></strong>is spot on.</p>
<p>Tai Chi is one of the only exercise systems you can take on later in life and truly excel at, so there must be something going on inside the slow-motion movements that lets anyone, of any age, and any level of ability start moving better.<br />

<h2>Re-Learn Healthy Movement</h2><br />
From years of helping people learn to move well, especially from the hips, I've distilled down <strong>3 key exercises that you'll need to unlock your frozen hips</strong>. I've put them together into a 9-part video course, that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new paradigm for healthy movement.</li>
<li>Two kinds of motion you must master.</li>
<li>Highly targeted preparatory exercises that lead you to the big payoff movements.</li>
<li>A practice routine that will keep you feel loose, grounded, and strong.</li><br />
</ul><br />

<blockquote><p>Dan is an extremely patient and caring person who knows his stuff. His competence combined with his sense of humor and seriousness in everything he does makes me feel I'm in good hands.  -- Vivien G.</blockquote><br />
Just a few minutes a day of targeted, flowing exercises can make a world of difference in how you move. You can even combine them with your existing fitness or wellness routine.</p>
<blockquote><p>I really enjoyed working with Dan; he catered the exercises to just where I was when we started and made subtle but critical modifications as I progressed. I've incorporated the drills I learned from Dan into my triathlon training and if I go for 2 or 3 days without them, I really notice an increase in my pain levels and the duration needed for full recovery between workouts. -- Rachel W.</blockquote></p>
<h2>A Word About Learning on Your Own</h2><br />
I know that trying to exercise and be healthy can be tough. You don't always feel like going to a crowded gym and grunting out reps on machines. It's also hard to find a good group exercise class, where you feel comfortable, engaged, and challenged in the right way.</p>
<p>In this course, I'm trying to help you lay a foundation of healthy movement that will allow you to get out and explore new movement opportunities. Many students tell me they feel more confident and even adventurous when old movement patterns that have been holding them back have suddenly been cleared up.</p>
<p>If you're taking this course on your own from home, though, I want to do everything I can (short of coming over!) to make you feel like you have the support you need. You can email me questions or even send me progress videos and I'll be happy to give you guidance and feedback.</p>
<h2>Get Started Today</h2><br />
Once you sign up, you can download the practice videos, watch them at your own pace, and start experimenting with the exercises on your own. Each lesson only takes a few minutes to practice.  Over time, you build up a whole new routine.</p>

<h2>My Guarantee</h2><br />
If for any reason you aren't satisfied with the quality of the information in the course or you don't get the feedback you're looking for, I will refund 100% of the course price. Obviously, a video series like this is not a substitute for a medical diagnosis, but if you're ready to learn new movement that will make you feel more flexible, stronger, and more balanced, then you have a no-risk opportunity when you buy this course.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dan understands the human body from a perspective unique to any other practitioner I've been to. I'm working with Dan on neck, shoulder and knee pain and it's fascinating to learn movements to do at home to heal long-term misalignments. The technique Dan uses is helping me on many levels.  -- Debbie M.</blockquote><br />
