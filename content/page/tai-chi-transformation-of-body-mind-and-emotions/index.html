When we work are working out we are trying to change some aspect of ourselves, whether it be building muscle, losing weight, or just releasing endorphins to induce happiness and relieve depression. Exercise does all that for us. If our physical bodies were all that we were however regular exercise alone would be be fine. But we think and feel as well and these processes need maintenance as well. The mind is linked to the body through the breath and it is when you bring these three aspects into harmony that you will get the most out of your body.</p>
<p>Back in the mid 20th Century a man named Charles Atlas perfected a new exercise routine called "dynamic tension". Instead of using either weight resistance or repetitive exercises to build muscle he used the body's own muscles to oppose each other, with phenomenal results,. Atlas's approach was an excellent example of making the body work in harmony. Tai Chi takes this approach to an entirely different level however. Instead of merely using the body to oppose itself, Tai Chi uses a more positive approach by teaching balance, i.e.: replying to hardness with softness..</p>
<p>Balance is achieved through unity and understanding the <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/01/07/the-transformational-power-of-tai-chi-body-mechanics/" target="_blank">body's dynamics</a> through movement and focus. The breathing moves in time with the natural movements of the body while focus is inward on the energies flowing through us, our Chi. The final goal for Tai Chi is to link us with the Chi and teach us how to manipulate it, freeing it to keep us at top health. This connection, once it is established, allows us to guide the Chi to problem areas and relieve its tensions. It has been shown time and again to be effective in treating physical conditions such as Parkinson's disease and cardiovascular problems. Because of its relaxing, calming effects it has also been used to tread anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>The process will soon lead to a complete translation. When the body and mind begin to <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/09/24/transforming-conflict-with-tai-chi/" target="_blank">work in harmony</a>, using the breath to create a pace, changes begin to happen. Students report a great improvement on any medical or psychological problems. Other, more subjective things, like balance, stability and attentiveness. We begin to notice the world around us in a much clearer fashion and, in many cases; students have noticed improvements after just a few short weeks.</p>
