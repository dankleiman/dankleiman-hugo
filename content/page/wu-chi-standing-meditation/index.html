One of the three most important skills needed when practicing any of the movement arts is focus. We must learn to develop our inner vision. This is what <a href="http://dankleiman.com/exercises/guide-to-standing-qigong">Wu Chi standing meditation</a> does for us. When we have completed our meditation session we will have a much deeper connection with not only our entire body but also the seat of our "chi", our internal energies. Until we establish this connection the exercises that we do, all of our form work, will have only minimal effect.</p>
<p>The following are some basic steps to practicing Wu Chi meditation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand in a relaxed position, feet shoulder width apart, shoulder width apart and eyes forward and closed. Your two hands should be hanging by the side of your upper thighs.</li>
<li>Now raise your hands to your abdomen, placing one over the other and at the same time lightly touch your palate with your tongue.</li>
<li>Drawing breath at a natural pace into the abdomen, picturing the breath moving through your body, filling you with energy, and then slowly releasing your breath, picture negative emotions and tensions leaving your body with the breath as it flows out in a brown cloud.</li>
<li>Now shift your focus to your navel. Just behind and slightly above your navel is the seat of your body's natural energy. You can visualize a glowing golden ball with threads running from it and covering your entire body, inside and out.</li>
<li>Beginning at the top of your head slowly move down your body, looking for tension. Some of the most common trouble spots are at the base of the skull, the lower neck, the shoulders and spine between the shoulder blades and the small of the back. Not only do these areas become tense overtime because of bad posture but emotional stress can block the energy channels here over time.</li>
<li>When a problem area is discovered you will be able to visualize the tensions and, again using visualization, simply make them go away. The stage has already been set on a physical level when you corrected your posture and regulated your breathing. The visualization is simply you giving yourself permission to be rid of this problem, reinforcing the idea over and over, at all levels.</li><br />

The was taken from pp. 7-8 of Master Feng Zhi Qiang's book Chen She Tai Ji Quan, with Wang Jie (Beijing 1990) and has been much abbreviated. There are many resources available however on this site, and in the course below, that will guide new students into becoming proficient at Wu Chi meditation.<br />
