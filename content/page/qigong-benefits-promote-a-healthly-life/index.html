<p>The modern world allows us to mix the best of current medical knowledge with ancient traditions for healing results. Qigong uses breathing, movement and meditation to find inner balance and promote positive energy. There is nothing mystical about this practice that helps humans heal by becoming in synch with their bodies. The practice pairs well with traditional cures for stress, anxiety and weight gain, and there are many Qigong benefits.</p>
<p><a title="Qigong Videos" href="http://dankleiman.com/qigong-videos/">Check out some of these Qigong Videos.</a></p>
<p>Qigong uses physical movement to revitalize the body. Anyone can use these routines because each action is timed with breath and requires thought. This means movements are usually slow and deliberate. The practice results in a series of physical benefits. One becomes more aware of the body which creates better balance, and muscles are stretched for more flexibility. Some also believe the process promotes youthfulness, slows aging and makes skin softer. Qigong is an easy routine to start the day with, and helps you get daily exercise.</p>
<p>Qigong benefits are believed to aid the organs because of the internal balance provided. The practice is supposed to aid the respiratory, digestive, immune and cardiovascular systems.  Giving the body time to relax and thinking positively is always recommended by doctors because it helps the body stay strong or recover. Qigong is a way to accomplish this whether one has serious illnesses or routine pains.</p>
<p>Some qiqong uses visualizations and sayings to achieve results. This can help with emotions by eliminating stress and promoting optimism, energy, tranquility and acceptance. Most people already use similar practices, and many counselors and therapists recommend calming techniques. Anyone who has a mantra to get through the day or who imagines an end result to stay motivated uses Qigong techniques already. However, purposely practicing Qigong channels the energy these tactics produce and makes them last longer.</p>
<p>Meditation has become respected for the effect it has on the mind. Taking a moment to breathe and focus helps center a person and produces clarity. Qiqong uses meditation to connect to the body and develop stillness, creativity and intuition.</p>
<p>Qigong is not a mysterious cure all for one's problems. It uses simple movement, breathing and meditation rituals that allow the body to calm and heal. Qigong benefits the body through exercise, relaxation and visualization. The practice pairs well with modern medicine to keep the body healthy and happy.</p>
