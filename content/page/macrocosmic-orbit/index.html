<p>The Macrocosmic Orbit is a practical basis for healing chronic illness and awakening psychic awareness of energy external to the body. It has been described as both an advanced Qigong exercise for strengthening the body's energy field and as a fundamental step in Inner Alchemy toward the union of Self and Tao.</p>
<p>Students first master the Microcosmic Orbit, which is a continuous flow of energy between the perineum and crown. Advanced practice extends this orbit to incorporate Earth chi. Some disciplines also draw upon cosmic energies, which provides the Chinese name for the practice as the "large heavenly round."</p>
<h2>Steps Toward Opening the Macrocosmic Orbit</h2><br />
The student's school determines the method of opening this set of energy channels. Some teachers emphasize active visualization and the manipulation of energetic flow by force of will. This fire method is seemingly contradicted by the water method of using breath and circular movements to gently awaken consciousness of the Macrocosmic pathways. Both contain elements of the other, and both are in general equally effective.</p>
<h2>Water Method</h2><br />
As expected, the water method is a passive observation that leads to growth in awareness. Students use a relaxed form of abdominal breathing and circular movements of the joints to gather energy and release it. Most Qigong schools prefer the water method.</p>
<p>In the Energy Arts Qigong system, the different elements of the Macrocosmic Orbit are developed in line with a Water Method approach through five core qigong sets. Each one focuses on a different elemen. You learn to access your energy and open the body in a different way with each one.</p>

<h2>Fire Method</h2><br />
The fire approach to growth of awareness relies heavily on the teaching of visualization and intensive breathing practices. Inner Alchemy practice, for instance, gives students the tools to begin visualizing and directing energy from the beginning. Breath training goes beyond abdominal breathing taught in Qigong. It includes such intense practices as packing-process breathing, which uses all muscles and sphincters of the abdomen to tightly concentrate breath on one location at a time.</p>
