These signals cause reactions, both physical and mental, which lead us through the activities of our day. If a person's ability to create adrenalin for instance they will lose the "fight or flight" instinctive reaction. The force that drives these necessary chemicals in our bodies is called in Eastern thought the "chi". The chi is stored in the body at one of the three "dantien" points and is drawn from two places: Our breathing takes in some of this vital energy and our contact with the Earth the rest.</p>
<p>We have already covered breathing on a number of occasions and now it is time to talk about establishing a connection with the Earth, or "rooting". <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/05/14/becoming-a-giant-rooted-spring-in-tai-chi/">Rooting</a> is done in much the same visual manner that breathing is brought into harmony. While standing in a standing meditation pose, feet shoulder width apart, shoulders and arms relaxed. When your breathing has been brought under control you will be able to switch your focus to your feet. The best results are obtained by planting your bare feet against the earth directly. Now visualize roots coming out of the bottom of your feet and extending into the earth. There are three aspects of these roots that are important to develop.</p>
<ul>
<li>The depth of the root is important but do not try to take on too much at once. The best practice is to begin with a shallow depth of about 20 feet or so. This can be extended over time to 50, 100, even 150 feet.</li>
<li>The thickness of the root is also important. It should be at least as wide as your body when you begin and then widened over time.</li>
<li>Finally, the responsiveness of your root is also vital. You should practice so that you can extend and widen it at will. A good exercise is to stand in a group of people and extend your root out until it is beneath all of them.</li><br />
</ul><br />
The deeper that you are able to bury your root, the more energy that will flow into your body and the root has the potential for bringing in more energy, as well as enhancing your balance and stability, that breathing because there is a limit to the amount of breath that you can take but no limit on the depth and width of your root.</p>
