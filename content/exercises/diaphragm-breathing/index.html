<p>People rarely think about breathing. It is little wonder; if people actively thought about their breathing, they would have little time to think about anything else. Breathing is an involuntary action, and it is crucial for survival. There are, however, different techniques of breathing, and studies have shown that some techniques are superior to others. Diaphragm breathing, in particular, in increasingly being viewed as a healthy way to breath, but its benefits go much further. Here are some facts about breathing from the diaphragm.</p>
<h2>What is Diaphragm Breathing?</h2><br />
There are two main ways of breathing. The most common way is to expand the lungs from all around. When breathing in this manner, the chest will push out and up slightly. While this is sufficient for normal breathing, it causes the body to do extra work. With diaphragm breathing, the diaphragm, a muscle beneath the lungs, pulls the lungs downward. When breathing in this manner, the stomach will push out slightly. For this reason, some call in stomach breathing.</p>
<h2>Better for Health</h2><br />
Research about breathing from the diaphragm has shown potential medical benefits. The primary benefit many point to is that it allows the lungs to absorb more oxygen. Chest breathing is great for exercise, but stomach breathing is better for promoting relaxation. Those who deal with anxiety or panic attacks may find their symptoms reduce significantly if they are able to successfully convert to breathing from the diaphragm.</p>
<h2>How do You Make the Switch?</h2><br />
Switching to diaphragm breathing will take some time for those who breathe primarily from the chest. Fortunately, the practice required will help people relax and focus. By concentration on one's breathing, it is possible to reach a state a relaxation where it is easier to concentrate. <a title="Sitting Qigong Meditation" href="http://dankleiman.com/sitting-qigong-meditation/">Meditation has been largely linked to breathing</a>, so those attempting the switch should try to think of their practice as a form of meditation. Over time, the body will adjust and breathing from the diaphragm will become a habit.</p>
<p>Try this simple exercise to get started:</p>

<p>Medical science has advanced tremendously in recent years, but some criticize the medical industry for avoiding simple steps that can lead to a better quality of life. One popular example is diaphragm breathing; the medical benefits are clear, and adjusting one's breathing can have profound physical and mental effects. Changing how one breathes will take some time, but the practice is easy and the results are well worth the effort.</p>
