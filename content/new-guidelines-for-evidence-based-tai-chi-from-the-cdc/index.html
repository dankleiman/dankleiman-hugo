<p><a href="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cdc_logo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4903" style="margin: 2px 7px;" alt="cdc_logo" src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cdc_logo-150x150.jpg" width="162" height="144" /></a>Sometimes people in the West, mostly because of their mechanistic world view, have a hard time catching up. In the early 1970's NASA decided that it needed a pen that would write in zero  gravity. After spending tens of millions of dollars they were finally able to invent one. The Russian space program simply used a pencil. We have two problems: We over think problems and we only look at surface appearances before making decisions. The Chinese have been using Tai Chi as a <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/12/17/tai-chi-moving-for-better-balance-with-dr-fuzhong-li/">healing art</a> for more than 30 centuries but even now many Westerners only think of old Bruce Lee movies when they see someone doing sets.</p>
<p>The Western medical community is  however finally catching up. The last several years however have seen several  prominent universities have conducted clinical studies on the effectiveness of tai chi in the prevention and/or t  treatment of various medical disorders. These studies have discovered that regular tai chi practice improves many of the body's natural functions, such as digestion and circulation. One of the most important findings however was that regular tai chi practice greatly improves balance, which helps prevent falls, and problem then becomes increasingly severe as we  grow older. This year the Atlanta Center for Disease Control (CDC) released guidelines for medical professionals to use tai chi for falls prevention programs.</p>
<p><a href="http://dankleiman.com/dr-fuzhong-lis-tai-chi-research/">Researchers</a> now know that tai chi practice increases balance, leg and hip strength, mobility and flexibility, all of which increases a person's confidence and reduces fear of falling. Since practice begins with meditation and requires focus throughout the exercises also reduce stress.  The CDC recommends at least 50 cumulative hours of practice to begin reducing the chances of falls in  adults. Most people take a one hour class, three times a week, for about six months.</p>
<p>The guidelines state that for patients older than  65 years  classes should be at least tw ice a week and patients should participate actively for at least 50 hours. Class instructions should include relaxation exercises and exercises which lower the center of gravity. Movement sets should be slowly introduced and care should be exercised when teadhing movement that bend the knee. Medical providers and therapists should exercise care when dealing with these patients however and tailor the pace to the individual patient.</p>
<p>The use of tai chi for healing is not firmly establihed in the Western Medical mind and its use is already becoming common place.</p>
