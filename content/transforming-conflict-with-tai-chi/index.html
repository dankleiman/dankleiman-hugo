<p>The Art of Tai Chi contains ancient tools that are essential for resolving the conflicts we face every day.</p>
<p><strong>But Tai Chi isn't just conflict resolution theory....</strong></p>
<p>You train your nervous system at the deepest level to respond to threat and pressure in the graceful, relaxed way that has made Tai Chi famous for centuries.</p>
<p>Check out these playful "under pressure" partner practices:</p>

<p>You learn to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle incoming force, whether it's a shove, a verbal threat, or an electronic one (hello, 10pm email!)</li>
<li>Neutralize threats by finding your root and learning to respond flexibly -- <em>you practice this physically, but the payoff is also more energetic and emotional flexibility!</em></li>
<li>Sense subtle, underlying tension that the other person is projecting at you before they even realize it</li><br />
</ul><br />
It all starts with the Internal State that you create....then each encounter becomes a chance to practice and refine your response, until you move through your day unfazed by the world coming at you.</p>
