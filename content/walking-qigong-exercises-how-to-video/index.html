<p>There are different methods for qigong walking.</p>
<p>In one school, qigong walking is called Kung and is one of the main exercises in Guolin Qigong. Medical therapists are currently using walking Qigong in the treatment of Crones Disease and even cancer. Developed more than 30 years ago it helped its creator, Madam Guolin recover from cancer and has now spread all over the world.</p>
<p>This not an exercise that can really be learned from written instructions however and bringing your movements into total harmony will take time. But this exercise is one of the most effective in the movement arts to help improve balance and flexibility.<br />
I understand that some of you might not be able to access and instructor however, and so I created a simple sample that you can try:</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/RpvNs88JJhs?rel=0" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://dankleiman.com/exercises/connecting-to-the-earth/" target="_blank">Download the companion audio here.</a></p>
<p>The most basic Qigong walk is composed of five parts. The Qigong walk is essentially an extension of the Qigong stance and can be modified to affect different organ systems. Each of the five parts to this walking exercise is an adjustment from our usual body movements. These adjustments open up new energy channels for healing a development of different body systems. The changes also teach us to bring our breathing and focus into our walking movements. These repetitive movements, as this audio download demonstrates, help generate and channel the chi throughout the body.</p>
<p>&bull; When most of us walk we do so in an at least partially flatfooted manner. The proper walk should have the heel hit the ground with the foot at about a 30&deg; and never drag your feet. This slight alteration in the step will increase the flow of qi to the kidney. The legs should be slightly bent at the knee and relaxed.<br />
&bull; Instead of swing your arms from front to back when you walk, move your arms around your body with a slight shoulder swing. Allow each hand to swing in front of the dantien as you move back and forth. The swings should be in harmony with both your breathing and step.<br />
&bull; Above we mention the harmony of the breathing with the step and arm swing. While doing walking Qigong exercise however you should take in two quick breaths instead of only one longer one and exhale as you normally would. Inhalation should occur as the foot hits the ground.<br />
&bull; The sideways body swing when we swing our arms can be increased and even exaggerated, by moving and keeping the center of gravity stable.<br />
&bull; Finally the movements of the head are important because the spine begins at this point. The spine is much like a chi superhighway. The head should be turned about 60&deg; on every even numbered set.<br />
When you are doing walking Qigong exercises you should keep your focus on the distant horizon and keep the pace set at a comfortable level. Keep your focus on the walk. When walking Qigong is used to treat medical issues, different paces are used for different conditions. A good exercise program for beginners would be 20 minutes of inhaling when the right foot strikes followed by 20 more minutes when the left foot strikes. Follow this with 20 minutes of meditation.<br />
