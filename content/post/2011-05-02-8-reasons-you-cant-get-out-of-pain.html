  content: "Your post is such a great reminder. Even though I know all 8 points intellectually,
    I seem to press on until I'm at the end of my rope, and THEN pay \"physical attention\"
    to my yelping body,  Your description broke it down perfectly.\r\n\r\nI find that
    a flow state is absolutely stronger than most pain. (Not so, in my experience,
    with energy drain.) I really don't feel pain when I take care of others, paint,
    draw, write or sing. My neighbors may well feel worse when I catterwall, though.
    \r\n\r\nWhat you wrote about the bad effects of perseverating on pain rings true
    too. I try to think of it as 'pain being obsessed with me. That way, I feel I
    have more veto power. I made up a coping mechanism that works incredibly well
    80-ish% of the time. I consider anything that's in my way of contentment and fulfillment
    to be a bother...a bother I call \"Murray\"...because it rhymes with Worry. Murray's
    the intruding worry voice in my head, and not part of my true temperament. When
    I feel bothered, I say to myself \"Shut up, Murray!\" It amuses me and reminds
    me I can refuse it. Works very well.\r\n\r\nThanks, Dan"

  content: 'Yeah, think about the difference between your state when you''re painting,
    writing, or drawing and when you are having a conversation with Murray. I think
    people tend to under-appreciate the former and think that pain has to be fought
    on the front where you are already having a direct, rational conversation with
    it. In my experience, the moments when it''s down to head-to-head confrontation
    are already lost. You need to step back and look at all those moments when it''s
    not on the radar. In Z-Health, the mantra is: the nervous system is always on.
    Your nervous system is telling you something in those moments just as much as
    it is telling you something in the painful moments. Thanks, Chris!'

<h2>1. You're lazy</h2><br />
Think about your daily movement patterns. How much variety is there? If you drive to work to sit at a desk and then relax by coming home and watching TV, you're living your life essentially seated in front of a screen. You need to change up the patterns: stand, run, twist, bend and move, not just your body but your eyes and head too.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-1016"></a></p>
<h2><strong>2. You eat crap </strong></h2><br />
<strong> </strong>What you eat has an impact on your pain levels from the point of view of your total energy system. If your diet is causing inflammation, you are spending way too much energy on dealing with your food because you're fighting what you put into your body. Experiment with adding more anti-inflammatory foods into your diet.</p>
<h2><strong>3. You're an emotional wreck </strong></h2><br />
<strong> </strong>Your emotional state impacts your pain levels. If you go around angry, depressed, and upset all the time, you are more likely to be in pain. Put on your favorite music, hang out with friends, laugh and see how even small tweaks can impact your mood and your pain.</p>
<h2><strong>4. You have terrible posture </strong></h2><br />
Chronic postural abnormalities can cause more pain because you're forcing your body to compensate in ways it's not designed to do. Don't think of posture as how you consciously hold your body, though. Posture is the result of how you move, on a sub-conscious level. Go back to point #1. If you don't have a varied diet of daily movement, your posture will suffer.</p>
<h2><strong>5. You don't sleep well </strong></h2><br />
We tend to underestimate the value of a good night's sleep. If you have trouble sleeping, you need to spend more time preparing for it each night. You might even need a couple of hours of lead time to begin to wind down. Cut off visual stimulation and find ways to feel your body, not feed your brain.<br />
<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>6. You're stressed out </strong></h2><br />
<strong> </strong>Researchers are blaming stress for exacerbating disease left and right. Stress lowers all your defense mechanisms and makes you more susceptible to illness. Pain is not an exception to this phenomenon. Look for ways to eliminate stress.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<h2><strong>7. You have old injuries </strong></h2><br />
<strong></strong>I put this way down on the list because most people think "Pain = Injury". It doesn't.&Acirc;  The body is really good at shutting down isolated parts to let them heal when the trauma initially occurs. The problem is that there is not reflexive mechanism for opening them back up after. Instead, you accumulate a series of shut down pieces and everything around them works to compensate. Go back and systematically open things up and you will lighten the load on everything else.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<h2><strong>8. You're obsessed with being in pain </strong></h2><br />
<strong></strong><strong></strong>Seriously, who reads a list called "8 Reasons You Can't Get Out of Pain"? The more you are fixated on pain, the more you will be in pain. You become what you practice, so use these tips to practice pain-free.</p>
<p>Now, I hope you know from reading this that I'm being a little heavy-handed here. Some of these things apply to you and some do not. The bigger point is that I want you to move away from the notion that "Pain = Broken or Injured". It really doesn't. As much as I hate the connotations of saying "pain is all in your head", from the point of view of your nervous system, it is. That doesn't mean pain isn't real. What it does mean though, is that treating pain is about talking to your nervous system ("your head"), not dealing with a specific piece of injured tissue. And you can talk to the nervous system on a lot of different levels. All of the factors outlined above could contribute to the experience of pain -- pain is highly contextual and highly individual. If you really want to get out of pain,stop hunting for the one little broken piece and take a much broader view of your pain experience.</p>
