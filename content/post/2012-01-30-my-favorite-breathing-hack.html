<p>The Wall Test is one of my favorite "breathing hacks" -- a simple, fast exercise you can do to get feedback on how well you are breathing. Check out this instruction in this video and try it for yourself:<br />

<p>This breathing exercise is taken from a live breathing class I taught last week. In the class, we looked at several different facets of training your breathing, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The difference between nerves, fluids, and chi when you practice.</li>
<li>How to play with internal pressures to get the biggest health benefit.</li>
<li>The quality of all-day energy you get from massaging your internal organs (which is really different from the typical "buzz" you think of from stimulants like caffeine).</li><br />
</ul><br />
The class included theory, practical guidance, and follow-along exercises. If you didn't have the chance to attend live, you can still get the webinar replay, which is over an hour long. <a title="To Breathe or Not To Breathe &acirc;&euro;" January 29 Webinar" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/01/16/breathing-webinar-january-29/">Sign up here for instant access</a>.</p>
