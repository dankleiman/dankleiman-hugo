<p>So, by the time this post is published, we should be closing in on 10,000 video views on YouTube. Now, I know that's not a huge number by internet standards and you can probably scroll through the YouTube sidebar and find individual videos that have more views than the entire <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/DKMovementArts">DKMovementArts channel</a> put together, but....<br />

<h2>I Just Wanted to Say "Thank You"</h2><br />
I don't care how that number stacks up with&Acirc;  other videos on YouTube. You know what it really means, right? It means the bigger conversation that you and I have been having here on DanKleiman.com is getting out there. People are listening and paying attention. To me, that's incredibly inspiring. It motivates me to keep sharing this message. So for that, I just wanted to say "thank you for your support!"</p>
<p>Here's the latest installment, a class report for our Early Spring 2012 classes at Brookline Tai Chi:</p>
<p><object width="560" height="315" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ByNAqZqbJ0Y?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="560" height="315" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ByNAqZqbJ0Y?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>If you've been watching these videos for a while, you may have noticed a subtle shift in background scenery in the last couple of videos. More on that soon....</p>
