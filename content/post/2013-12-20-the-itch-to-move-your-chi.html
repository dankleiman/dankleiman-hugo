  content: "Ah, two simple three letter words: Dao and tea.\r\nA friend loaned me
    her copy of the recent issue of the magazine, \"The Empty Vessel.\"\r\nIt has
    an interview with a tea master from Portland (Paul Rosenberg.)\r\nSeems like the
    ancient Daoists cultivated both Qi and tea.\r\n\"Tea brings you into the Dao.\"\r\n\r\nSo
    my New Year's resolution is to substitute tea for my daily mochas.\r\nAlready
    I have more energy."

  content: It is interesting that energy circulation is not discussed very much in
    BKF's curriculum. At least in the parts that are published. I haven't attended
    his workshops. so it could be discussed there. But yes, before circulating something
    one should have something to circulate. But this could be a discourse on eggs
    and chickens.

  content: "I look at the \"egg and chicken\" paradox in several ways:\r\n\r\n1. Qi
    exists.  But it might take eons to feel it.\r\n2. Assume that Qi exists.  Even
    if it is a \"null\" quality, the \"null\" set is the very foundation of higher
    mathematics and calculus.  The whole system, tai chi as well as mathematics, is
    based on the \"zero.\"  If you're an a-Qi-theist, you might as well not even practice
    tai chi.\r\n3. Qi is related to blood circulation.  The tai chi classics say that,
    the mind leads the Qi, the Qi leads the blood, the blood leads the body.  Anatomically
    we know how the blood flows and circulates; therefore the Qi would be circulating
    just ahead of blood flow.\r\n4. Frantzis does mention Qi circulation in many of
    his works.  For example, the First movement in \"Dragon and Tiger Medical Qigong\"
    traces \"energy pathways\" which coincide with acupuncture meridians.\r\nOf course,
    this is Qi Gung, not tai chi.\r\n5. Qi circulation in tai chi is different from
    the Qi circulation in Qi Gung and acupuncture.\r\nFrantzis makes this point in
    his \"Tai Chi Mastery Course.\"\r\nIn acupuncture Qi circulation follows a set
    pattern (Lungs: up &amp; out to the hands/head; then Large Intestine: down &amp;
    \ in to feet/chest; Stomach: down to feet; Spleen: up and back to chest.\r\nIn
    tai chi the energy is moving in &amp; out of the central channel and dantiens--the
    microcosmic orbit is involved.\r\n6. Qi works.  Sink it and you are well-grounded.\r\n7.
    Qi is mental.  We don't see our \"blindspot\" because the brain fills it in.  The
    optic nerve does not transmit iinfo about blue light, but our brain \"constructs\"
    many hues of blue.  Maybe there is no Qi, but our brain can \"construct' it as
    a percept.\r\n8. Qi is quantum, a flux.  It exists as both a wave and a particle
    at the same time until observed."

<p>We tend to think about our energy level like the money we have in the bank. You wake up in the morning, look in your energetic wallet and say, "I've got a lot of energy today" or "Man, I need 7 cups of coffee."</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, thanks to this New Yorker cartoon:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.condenaststore.com/-sp/If-we-re-all-just-energy-then-why-don-t-I-have-any-New-Yorker-Cartoon-Prints_i8481061_.htm"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4975" alt="If we're all just energy, then why don't I have any?" src="/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-20-at-8.14.34-AM.png" width="577" height="445" /></a></p><br />
In qigong, we think about "having energy" a little bit differently. Often, it's not just how much or how little, but <strong>how well is your energy circulating?</strong></p>
<p>Good energetic circulation gives you a feeling of "more," while stagnant or stuck energy feels draining.</p>
<p>Since this is such a different concept than most of us have, I've often wondered about where these two ideas came from and where these two ways of seeing the world split. In this post, I'm not going to give you a deeply researched exploration of the origins of the Taoist understanding of the world. I'll let <a title="Straight Lines, Circles, and Spheres" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/04/11/straight-lines-circles-and-spheres/">our practices</a> stand as of evidence of that.</p>
<p>Instead, I want to share with you some of the writings of 20th century Western philosopher Hans Jonas. He wrote about the phenomenology of life and in his descriptions of biological processes, we get a really interesting connection to what many qigong practitioners come to realize: <strong>we have a fundamental need to circulate chi.</strong></p>
<p>In <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Phenomenon of Life</span>, Jonas is trying to reconcile the simplest forms of life with higher thought and our human experience of the mind. He tries to place them on a continuum and asks which one is for the sake of the other.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whatever the answer, one aspect of the ascending scale is that in its stages the "mirroring" of the world becomes ever more distinct and self-rewarding, beginning with the most obscure sensation somewhere on the lowest rungs of animality, even with the most elementary stimulation of organic irritability as such, in which somehow already otherness, world, and object are germinally "experienced," that is, made subjective, and responded to (p.3).</blockquote><br />
My personal theory on the origins of qigong is that those early Taoists went exploring.</p>
<p>They sat or stood in postures and listened, both inside themselves and to the natural world. <strong>As they got quieter and more perceptive, the heard the echoes of Jonas' "most obscure sensation."</strong> The irritability that Jonas describes set them up against the world outside and framed their inner worlds.</p>
<p>That irritability is the same itch you feel when you know you need to get your chi moving, circulating through you and passing back and forth between you, the natural world around you and the other people you interact with.</p>
<p>When things are flowing, in and out, up and down, towards and away, we feel good: <strong>connected to something outside ourselves but at the same time internally unified and integrated.</strong></p>
<p>Just like eating, breathing, and sleeping, circulating energy is a natural cycle that we can refine, enhance, and enjoy, but we need to pay attention to it on an ongoing, continuous basis to be healthy and feel whole.</p>
