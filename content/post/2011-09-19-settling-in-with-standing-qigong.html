  content: "Hey Dan, \nthank you for this - really appreciate your blog.\nI found
    on a course I did in Crete, it was really nice to settle in and pay attention
    to my surroundings and relax slowly and with no pressure, before trying to relax
    in standing. If the surroundings are pleasant, they can help your relaxation.\nIf
    they are a bit noisey or a bit of a distraction, it's no harm to be aware of them
    first before you try turning down the distraction like the volume on a radio.\nSl&Atilde;&iexcl;n,\nDara"

  content: "Hey Dan,\n\nI love this idea! We use a similar 'settling-in' phase in
    Pilates but done lying down on a mat, so it was really interesting to hear a standing
    tai-chi version :) \n\nYou have a really great manner, very relaxing, and certainly
    helps with getting into the right headspace for movement practice.\n\nLooking
    forward to the next posts!\nLorna"

  content: "Thanks, Lorna. \r\n\r\nCan you say a little bit more about the role of
    the settling-in practice in Pilates? In qigong, it can become a practice in and
    of itself. It's not unusual to do the standing work for 30-45 minutes.\r\n\r\nLater
    on, there is carry-over to moving practice, beyond just getting ready, so I'm
    curious to know if you look at it in terms of other skill transfer too.\r\n\r\nDan"

  content: "Hey Dan,\r\n\r\nPilates sessions are split into three phases, opening,
    main and closing. Relaxation/settling in is usually placed in the opening phase
    and might last five to fifteen minutes. \r\n\r\nThe aim of relaxation at the start
    of a Pilates session is to focus the mind on the breath and the body ready for
    the main phase of exercises. Joseph Pilates said the aim of his exercises was
    to have the entire body under complete mental control: that's a tough thing to
    do if you've just rushed home from work and are worrying about what to make for
    dinner! \r\n\r\nBody Control Pilates (who I trained with) even have a 'relaxation
    position' which is basically lying on your back with your knees bent and feet
    flat on the floor. The relaxation phase would usually begin with this position
    and then some basic movements of arms, legs, pelvis and spine to encourage focus,
    attention and mental and physical relaxation before getting into harder exercises.\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps/is of interest! I can go on about Pilates all day...!\r\nLorna"

  content: That's great, Lorna. I think being aware of "how you practice" is just
    as important as "what you practice'. Thanks!

<p style="text-align: left;">Do you include a "settling-in" phase each time you practice?</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If not, you're wasting time and energy resolving issues from your day when you could be going deeper into your practice.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A settling-in phase acts as a buffer between your busy day and the place you'd like your practice to take you.</p><br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-2113"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Standing qigong is one of the best buffers between "real life" and "practice time". You could jump right into your tai chi form, but you'd need to do 10 or 15 minutes of "cold" tai chi, with no warm-up, to arrive at the same place, ready to practice, after 5 minutes of standing and settling in.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Check out this guided practice session (download the mp3 below).&Acirc;  In this 5-minute scan, you'll align your body, release the first layer of accumulated tension from your day, and slow your mind down to a speed where your subsequent movement practice will be much more refreshing and restorative.</p></p>

 </p>
<p>I recommend that you start your practice off with a 5-minute settle every day for the next week. You'll also discover a little trick: on those days you don't feel like practicing, 5 minutes of guided scanning like this can prime your nervous system and get you over that "no practice" internal resistance. Try it!</p>
<p>Up next in this series: a 10-minute practice where I'll show you how to "wake up your feeling awareness". After that, we'll look at a powerful way to refresh yourself in a 20-minute recording on "sinking your chi". I'll be posting these as weekly updates, so be sure you're on the email list below or check back with <a href="http://dankleiman.com/tag/standing-series/">this bookmark</a> to see the entire series.</p>
