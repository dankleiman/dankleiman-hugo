<p>Frozen shoulder is one of those terms that people accept with resignation and it seems like a plausible explanation...until you start to poke around in your own nervous system.</p>
<p>If you've ever been told you have a frozen shoulder, I urge you to look a little bit beyond the (overly) simple mechanical explanation.</p>
<p>Obviously, I'm not diagnosing your shoulder from a YouTube video, but I just want you to ask a few more questions and try these two experiments:<a id="more"></a><a id="more-2746"></a><br />

<h2>What to do about a Frozen Shoulder</h2><br />
If you tried the experiments in the video and saw some changes in your shoulder movement, your best bet is to find someone who can assess your movement on a global (whole-body) level. This person, <a title="Find a Z Health Trainer near you" href="http://edge.affiliateshop.com/public/AIDLink?AID=99991&amp;BID=1347">like a certified Z Health instructor</a>, for example, will be able to see what body parts are not moving when they should be and which ones are when they shouldn't be.</p>
<p>You can alleviate a lot of "frozen" anything in the body with this approach.</p>
<p>If you can't find an instructor near you, the next best thing is to begin a head-to-toe, full-body mobility program, <strong>focusing on everything else except your frozen shoulder </strong>(<a title="Z Health R-Phase Manual and DVD" href="http://edge.affiliateshop.com/public/AIDLink?AID=99991&amp;BID=13446">the Z Health R-Phase series is the best way to go about this</a>). The number one rule you need to follow is "never move into pain." Instead, you will re-educate your body and all its moving pieces, taking the burden off the parts that are already working too hard.</p>
<p>Fairly quickly (like, within a few good training sessions), you will see a change in how you move, 90% of the time. If you keep it up, you'll prevent further aggravation along these lines.</p>
<p>I have a few more ideas if you're looking for other ways to <a title="Get Moving" href="http://dankleiman.com/get-moving/">GET MOVING</a> too.</p>
