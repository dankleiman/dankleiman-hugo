excerpt: When we started asking our students at Brookline Tai Chi about their home
  practice, we got a really interesting range of habits and preferences. Since then,
  we've been trying out different tools to help spark more home practice. Stepping
  back for a minute, I'd really like to know more about why you practice. Take a minute
  drop me a line (filing out the form below is private and goes right to me, no one
  else).
