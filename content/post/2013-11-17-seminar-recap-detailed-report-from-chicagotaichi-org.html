<p>I was thrilled to be able to share a weekend of Tai Chi in Chicago earlier this month, thanks to Energy Arts Instructor Chris Cinnamon and his students at Enso Tai Chi.</p>
<p>Chris just posted an incredibly detailed report summarizing the workshop <a href="http://www.chicagotaichi.org/2013/11/17/putting-more-chi-in-our-tai-chi-in-chicago-update-on-enso-tai-chis-fall-workshop-with-dan-kleiman/">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you read between the lines a little bit, you can come up with some great ways to structure your own practice. Think of the whole day as a single practice session. Can you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Settle in</li>
<li>Let your mind and energy sink all the way through you</li>
<li>Expand your awareness 360 degrees around you</li>
<li>Simultaneously find new space inside your body</li>
<li>Grow that new space outward without tension or strain</li><br />
</ul><br />
To me, this would be a nice restorative and engaging practice session. How do you normally structure yours?</p>

<p><strong>Thanks again to everyone who came out for some Tai Chi!</strong></p>
