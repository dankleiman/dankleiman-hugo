  content: "Question on this, Dan - have you tried doing this for long periods of
    time and if so, have you seen a change in your metabolism? I've heard about this
    sort of thing being done by Buddhist monks in Tibet and I've always wondered how
    this might effect your energy level. My assumption is that extending your energy
    to provide warmth would burn more fuel (food), but I'd love to know more. \r\nThanks,\r\n
    \       James"

  content: 'James, I haven''t. I''ve read similar things and this is one site that
    explores the issue: http://hypothermics.com/home/ Check out the TED talk in the
    sidebar. Interesting topic. Maybe I''ll work on it more next winter. ;-)'

  content: "I just wanted to write that the recent posts about dissolving/ vs sinking,
    practice-recipe/adjustment, (and what you call Form vs Feel), have been neat-
    I espec found the slideshow about skill-acquisition (by Hubert Dreyfus) great
    [but I couldn't comment there, so I did here :)]\r\n     I just wanted to comment
    about above, as I used to work along these lines a bunch (even had a hypothermic
    'experience- unrelated, but interesting physio reference-pts, how wet-cold, fog
    with a \"wind-chill\" soaked, and tired, is much more debilitating than icy-cold..
    \  of course, it isn't nearly as cold around here as \"frozen Niagra Falls\" gee)
    - anyway,  when I was in gradeschool I first read about the Tibetan tales, so
    it percolated in back of mind..  and I find interesting how in our Common-Sense
    understandings it is so often brought up about metabolism (as if Yogi's living
    in caves have access to \"as much food\" as we in a city do, let alone \"a lot
    more\" as the model is more \"metabolism-heat\" produced from more fuel- so they
    eat \"more\" calories than we would?   vs bowl or two meals a day...\r\n     just
    a though for reference- even if only in contrast..\r\n\r\n   Whether in chi work
    (dissolving or circulating as two extremes- and a third being quiescent-stillness...
    \ just as Sitting/standing still vs a moving practice should be kept distinct,
    they do transition -and inform- each other... likewise as Bruce mentions the different
    NeiGung sets, and TaiChiChuan and BaguaZhang should all keep their distinctive
    Flavors.. and yet there is a crossover connection: which allows for comparison-contrasting
    (over time). \r\n\r\n    I think the key is to not try and Figure it out, but
    rather be exposed to a bunch of exper-data-pts.. and encounter the mass of them
    (as a whole) and let the Con of you sort of arise what it sees.  (sort of like
    seeing a shape in the clouds, or those random-dot stereogram pictures), and each
    new observation Seen= a realization, when once integrated, affects  ..  which
    (once stabilized) can produce a new Seeing)...    The key is to be in the state
    of unknowing (from the    Hubert Dreyfus (re Skill-Acquisition): \"To become competent,
    you must feel bad.\" ... which brings to mind for me the Concept of being able
    to Hold In Mind- two, mutually exclusive concepts, simulatneously for a period
    of time.. and that underlying tension/ literally cognitive-dissonance, will resolve
    itself (and to do so without: spacing out, or representing that dynamic by a label,
    nor locking it down). the longer it is allow to flex on its own, the parts reveal
    a new whole.)\r\n\r\n    in short- that method (can) \"reveal\" in NeiGung (whether
    during a \"doing\" or during a \"stillness\"   -both of which are in all practices)
    \   That \"Ughnghh\" undefinable is (sinking or Downward dissolving (different)
    changes to Either: dissolving (which goes outward  inward); but also twist/turn
    or spiral.. or circ etc..  they are all like you just do it, the same way one
    \"moves a finger\"  -how do you Move the left middle finger? (a valid question
    if someone is injured and having difficulty with that coord- its not just a non
    sequitur-gimme...  but one can either do it a bit, or not (once you can- you can
    develop more familiarity, more complexity, more skill&amp;strength, etc.).. but
    if can't then- you try and do what you can to \"brush up against it\"   and then
    stabilize some contact..\r\n\r\n     I don't know if that might make sense to
    any (but in case: my concept- 3 stages- not sure, grasping in dark (thus linking
    up to what is known, feel on the edge a bit further, etc.), then sort of maybe-
    I'm not sure... and then ok there is \"that\"...     (which stage at depends on
    how clearly one is doing whatever)..\r\n---------------\r\n  last in terms of
    above about applications of Tumo Ideas, my thought (each their own) is that I
    avoid the temptation to see some practices that seem related and just lump them..
    (ie if operating in Neigung via Hsin/heart-mind with \"Chi\" one is operating
    in a bit different than 'chi-gung' think-effort-do... vs Shengung.. and all of
    these I think are different from what seems to be a physiological mitochondrial
    elicitation (as an example, I'd recommend the talks-and Demonstrations by Wim
    Hof..  did a TED talk (where the \"presenter\" seemed a bit more motivated to
    make it a show, rather than his demo of what humans can do) but other demos- and
    he co-wrote a book (with another that learned his \"non-dogma\" approach, that
    seems less like Tibetan-Tumo (psychic-heat), and actually (in my learnings) to
    be like Indonesian Tenaga Dalum (see \"Becoming the Iceman- pushing past perceived
    limits\", pub 2011)\r\n\r\n   I hope this message isn't way to long, or off topic
    (just saw Rise: 300 this evening, and then online read these posts, and it seemed
    to connect and inspire :)\r\n\r\n   *my two sense (cents) on adding to the above
    6 steps- is the key of watching the Awareness (not the forcing-pushing energy,
    although the \"thing\" mentioned is like the pilot-light behind which-shines through
    that (as that forcing-pushing sense of \"awake\" is more a result of organ-E-flow,
    while the Con that underlies is that which either: swells up (feels larger/fuller
    and more present , or that can (rather than be larger/fuller) it can dim and drift
    back (retreating away\r\n      its that more primary source which can increase
    and back-away a bit, and yet not be really noticable from within \"normal-con-awareness\"
    (as the awareness dims along with its sense of where it is dim or not- if that
    isn't too convoluted).\r\n            Sensing when in contact with DisComfort
    (in above ex by Dan- cold.. but also the \"unknown\" repressed- gunk parts of
    Energy, or stuck in a loop/not want to complete a pattern and thus it is a blockage..
    \ in other words \"don't go there\" for whatever reason)- when contact that, how
    does that deeper Con react (which happens prior to, as well as underlying, our
    slow-ponderous reaction/programs....     (that part if is starts to dim and turn
    off from a discomfort, like cold, ends up not Adapting to it... vs if you encounter
    that discomfort (cold) and from that first encounter-contact that con not only
    doesn't dim- but enhances/expands.. and further shines upon it.   (all of which
    is observed and perhaps recognized, but if that is \"done\" purposefully, that
    is like using your toes to \"move your finger\".. the finger moves on its own-
    the right \"tool\" used by the right \"person\" for the job (ie part of mind-con).
    \ \r\n\r\n   (that sense of subtle-delicate \"crystal matrix\" ie gentle and not
    shatter it, over time that indefinable whiff, becomes more stable and solid and
    more resilient, like stacking up thin-\"onion\" tracing paper..  sheet by sheet,
    hardly makes a pile.. but eventually a slight thickness.. then longer is thick
    (at that point the dyn-flips: if take-off, ie \"use\" a few sheets, one hardly
    notices)\r\n       Anyway, I hope that might contrib some thing on these topcs
    (not boiled down- so a bit long, vs the succinct posts by Mr. K)\r\n==================\r\n
    \  another ref is that works by Jack Schwarz  (who discovered he could encounter
    and adapt to physiological \"discomfort\" also.. and then he tried to \"interpret\"
    what he did (thus he ties in to the \"topics of the day\" saying its like XYZ..
    and yet I read that was an attempt to bridge, as what he did was (move the finger)-
    he didn't use cold, as much, more skewer shoved through &amp; rapid healing- etc.\r\n
    \  (book I read way back was: Voluntary Controls: Exercises for Creative Meditation
    and for Activating the Potential of the Chakras  (I wouldn't read it as literal-
    \"recog those terms\" etc.  as his use-model...\r\n   not sure about the other
    titles, although having read talks/articles he did over time. \r\n\r\n   -also
    if one find the Tenaga Dalum: the vibrating from either: A) the most-closed:  (HE?)
    via the moment reaching exhaled, just as one is beginning to inhale (so feeling
    that change-over vs that extension held)... or B) the most expanded  (KAI?) via
    the moment reaching inhaled, just as turning over to ex....     two different
    feels of one force- seeing through the common one can sense a \"current\" which
    is both beyond both, and is neither, yet underlies (contacted via evoked by teacher-
    ie transmission)...  just as a reference comparison.\r\n\r\n    tried to give
    a few examples in case relavant or find a way to relate  (if this needs to be
    edited down)\r\nluck to all in practicing"

  content: "Just a quick(er) comment: I think both the cold-practices, let alone other
    ChiGung concepts, might be seen in the context of Bruce's comment that most (I
    read nearly all) \"Taoist\" practices out there are Fire Method (which is also
    \"neo-taoist\"), vs Water Method (older/original? taoist)... \r\n    so if that
    is the way that Taoist practices are (which Tao-trad seemed to makes those a polarity
    and thus explicit concepts)..  how much more so are other practices?  (ie nearly
    all seems to be a Fire Method approach?)  \r\n\r\nFurther I'd say that most are
    Seen-Through a perspective/interpretation of a \"fire-method\" Post-modern viewpt
    of a \"fire-method\" modern practice\r\n    vs\r\n  a fuzzy viewpt of a \"water-method\"
    pre-modern practice\r\n\r\n  ie practice not only in terms of the underlying logic
    of the world-view that structures that practice, but also how to make sense of
    it- so not only the concept of doing it, but even how we (re)-interp it.\r\n   -let
    alone the difference in how one-\"gets it\" when: \r\n    I) first approaching
    an aspect (as an introductory fumbling all the way up to being certain what one
    is doing- not skill or mastery, just solid, ah this is what I mean to do..);  then
    once a solid sense of do or not: \r\n    II)developing stability (vs that butterfly
    on it-lost it), which can develop to the separate (and after that- to a sense
    of combo)\r\n     just to throw in those two pts (I vs II) within the above Fire-water
    practice, in addition to the interpretation seen through, could help reveal how
    the lens can distort  (not to be something to try and figure out- just a sense
    of 3 or 4 different \"areas of affect\" which float attention on, and allow what
    arise to reveal itself."

  content: Thanks for the link, Dan! This is something I've been wondering about for
    a long time. I've put a lot of effort into changing my diet and fitness patterns,
    in the last year. While this was going on, I moved to Colorado where I'm at 8,500
    ft. and the weather is much different than what I've been used to. I've always
    thought that there has to be some physics that needs to be accounted for, in terms
    of thermodynamics, so it's interesting to take a look at what Science has to say
    on the subject.

<p><img src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/iStock_000034767246Small-291x300.jpg" alt="Winter tree in the mountains" width="291" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5018" />It's been such a cold winter in the Northeastern US this year, that even Niagara Falls has frozen over. </p>
<p>Every night, students come in to class shivering, that is, once they've resolved to venture out in the cold and the dark. And many haven't even been up for that.</p>
<p>Today I want to tell you about an important practice lesson you can learn from all this cold. You will develop a better feel for the chi of your etheric body and stay warmer in the process.</p>
<p>Normally, when you step out into frigid temperatures, your reaction is to tense up, contract your body, and shiver to keep warm. </p>
<p>You should do the opposite. </p>
<p>Here is a short qigong practice you can use to relax, warm-up, and even improve your sensitivity to the energy that runs your physical body.</p>
<p><strong>Embrace the Cold</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Stand, with your arms by your sides, legs relaxed and weight balanced through the feet.</li>
<li>Feel the cold air around you and how it's making contact with your body, through all your layers of clothing.</li>
<li>Notice any reaction to contract or withdraw.</li>
<li>Gently, from the outer edges of the body, expand to meet the cold, reversing the tendency to tense up.</li>
<li>Focus on the contact between your body and the cold air around you.</li>
<li>With time, expand the mind into the space around the body, feeling out into the cold, as if you were sensing for temperature. </li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>Now, when we tell people to extend their minds beyond their bodies, that can often seem strange, esoteric, or even impossible, but we do this naturally.</p>
<p>Have you ever felt someone walk up behind you? Can you feel the heat without touching the fire? I hope so!</p>
<p>Learning to sense the chi in your etheric field requires the same kind of sensory activation that you use for many mundane activities. When you embrace this winter's cold, you have another great opportunity to enhance your senses and expand your awareness of chi.</p>
