<p>I care just as much about "how you practice" as "what you practice". At a certain point, you should be paying attention to both equally.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-603"></a></p>
<p>For your own practice, I think Dr. Cobb sums it up nicely <a href="/2011/01/08/work-speed-mistakes/">here</a>, where he describes the delicate balance between putting your head down and working hard and sitting back to reflect on your hard work.</p>
<p>When you think about crafting a training experience for a student or client, you need to think about how you can, in the words of Dr. BJ Fogg, "put hot triggers in the path of motivated people."</p>
<p>On a whole different level, take the advice of <a href="http://www.energyarts.com/content/liu-hung-chieh-taoist-lineage-master" target="_blank">Taoist Sage Liu Hung Chieh</a>: "you become what you practice."</p>
