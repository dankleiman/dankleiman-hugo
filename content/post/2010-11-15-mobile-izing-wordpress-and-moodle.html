<p>I spent a fair amount of time today upgrading the site and my phone so that I would have better mobile access to the site on my phone and so that you can too!</p>
<p>Here's what I ended up doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding the <a href="http://mobilepress.co.za/" target="_blank">MobilePress</a> plugin to DanKleiman.com, so that the site adapts to your mobile browser</li>
<li>Installing the Wordpress app on my Droid, so that I can update the site from my phone</li>
<li>Installing <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Moodle_for_Mobiles" target="_blank">Moodle for Mobiles</a>, which is "is designed to work with mobile phones in Japan". Is that why it failed? I couldn't get the php to run cleanly.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Overall, I think this was a good step forward, except for the Moodle situation. It looks like there are several different native apps for mobile devices that are or are becoming available. That's good. I don't know if I'll have to modify the site to accommodate them or what. Depending on how I migrate current clients of mine over to Trainerfly, I may or may not look into this further.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading a site update!</p>
