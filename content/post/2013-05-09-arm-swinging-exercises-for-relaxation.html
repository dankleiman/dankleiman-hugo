<p><a href="/uploads/2013/05/index.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4588" style="margin: 8px 4px" alt="index" src="/uploads/2013/05/index.jpg" width="106" height="90" /></a>The study of Tai Chi requires that you also study Qigong as well, separate from your Tai Chi Classes. The tensions that we feel, both physically and psychology are largely the result of blockages in our body's <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/12/21/case-study-energy-gates-tune-up/">natural energy paths</a>. Qigong refers to this energy and it is the study of bringing our breathing into harmony with our movement. One of the best Qigong exercise is the arm-swing exercise. Usually done as a warm-up, it prepares the body for relating the movement of your arms with your shoulders and spine.</p>
<p><a href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/11/16/the-challenge-of-the-three-swings/">Arm-swinging exercises</a> are very easy to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand in the Tai Chi position, feet shoulder width apart, shoulders relaxed, faced forward.</li>
<li>Sink your weight into your knees</li>
<li>Beginning at your hips, rotate slowly to your left, then to your right, keeping your arms loosely at your side. Any movement of your arms should come from the swing of your body. Continuing this movement back and forth will cause your arms to spin further out.</li>
<li>Do not count the reputations of your arm swings. Instead count the time spent swinging, beginning with 5 minutes if you are in average, less if you have medical issues. Increase the amount of time swinging weekly if possible at least 5 minutes.</li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>Harvard Health says that Qigong has been shown to be helpful in managing stress, anxiety, depression, as well as a number of physical maladies such as Parkinson's, diabetes, and heart disease. The connection between stress and depression and heart disease has been well established. Arm-swinging exercises help stimulate blood flow and the slapping of your hands against your body is good for your cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>During movement exercise, Tai Chi sets, you will find the same dynamics come into play as you used in the arm swinging exercise. This is another benefit of using these exercises is that they use the same motions that you will be using in your practice, thereby pre-loosening the muscles and joints and reducing the chance of injury.<br />
