  content: Thanks Dan for your thoughts on progress. I liked it when you mentioned
    that one could get stuck in standing practice rather than move on to more adanced
    stuff. Would you say there are some check points that would indicate there is
    a time to move on? Or one should just feel the time has come?

  content: I think it's more about comparing what your standing feels like to your
    moving practice. If you assume that one of the most basic goals of standing is
    to develop internal listening skills, then you can test how well you can listen
    while moving or interacting with someone. When you have a feel for that, you might
    move on to train something else in your standing....so I think it's circular in
    that sense.

  content: "Very much appreciated, Dan! A very good pointer.\r\n\r\nI also want to
    thank you for your enthusiasm and energy. I train on my own and don't go to any
    qigong/taiji school, so this kind of encouragement that I feel from your site
    is very helpful."

  content: Thanks, Igor. One of my main goals of the site is to reach people who are
    out there working solo and help them connect with ideas and people the way we
    do in our school. Glad that's coming through!

  content: "I found that very useful. I like your metaphors Dan, they are really helpful
    in gaining a better understanding to certain concepts relating to my practice.
    \ In terms of learning how to listen internally with sinking for example after
    about 15 months of working on it, I feel like Im holding a match in a dark room:)
    \ Occasionally the match flickers and seems to go out occasionally or it just
    wont seem to strike at all!  I realize that I just need to keep \"drawing circles\"
    \ .  Thats what I love about these practices is that its NOT instant gratification.
    \ We are really getting to know and cultivate our true selves on a deeper level
    each time we practice and Ive felt as Ive grown slightly more aware of my internal
    environment the same has happened with my external awareness.\r\nThis episode
    helped me to reflect on my personal goals with my practice and where Id like to
    go.\r\nIm so stoked on the Energy Arts system that I dont see myself seeing an
    instructor for any other form, method  or style.  I just feel like what Ive learned
    in the past 2 and a bit years or so with the EA system and working with Dan online
    has had such a big impact on my practice and body and life.  Seeing as it will
    likely be awhile or a year or more (who knows really-could be sooner than I think!)
    until I get a chance to train personally with an EA instructor, I figure its best
    to stick with what Im working with now (Energy Gates, Dragon &amp; Tiger, and
    Taoist Meditation) and dig my well deep as Bruce put it rather than bite off more
    than I can chew and digest.\r\nI feel like my expectations these days are slim
    to nil.......so , Im just enjoying the ride and am really enjoying working especially
    with energy gates right now.  It seems like the possibilities of this set are
    near endless and with my situation will likely keep me busy for awhile!  Bagua
    really appeals to me and so does tai chi . Long term though I think Id like to
    aim for learning  16 nei-gong through all the core qigong sets in the EA system:).
    \ I figure that will likely keep me busy for at least this life-time!\r\nIm also
    really looking forward to begin working through Mr. Tangora's book.  By the looks
    and sounds of it, I think it will compliment my practice just nicely.\r\nOne question
    I have about the book is in its title and this may be quite obvious to some but
    Im curious  how cloud hands and its internal structure is related to the exercises
    taught in the book?\r\nAs always thank you for sharing your knowledge, insights
    and feedback, Dan."

  content: "Kevin,\r\nGreat update! It's a huge milestone when you get into that mindset
    with your practice. And it all sounds like a good plan.\r\n\r\nOn Cloud Hands,
    Robert uses the symmetrical movements of Cloud Hands from the Tai Chi form to
    work on all the internal principles of Tai Chi. If you think of all the complexity,
    variety, and specificity of the form itself, and all the applications each movement
    implies, it's incredibly helpful to have a simple container to train principles
    in. Then you go put those principles into the more complex movements. \r\n\r\nThat's
    my sense for why....\r\n\r\nThe exercises in his book, similar to the neigong
    in the Energy Arts curriculum, each highlight a different principle or internal
    technique you are trying to develop."

<p>That means there are lots of good questions floating around about getting started, making progress, and the frustrations you encounter along the way.</p>
<p>In this episode of Qigong Radio, I hope to address some of those concerns.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-4000"></a></p>
<p>Specifically, I discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think is the ultimate goal of your practice, anyway?</li>
<li>Do you have a "listening" practice in your current routine?</li>
<li>Where is the gel point in your daily practice?</li><br />
</ul></p>
