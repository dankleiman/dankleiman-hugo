<p>If you listed to the recent Qigong Radio episode on <a title="The Essential Elements of Tai Chi Balance Training" href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/07/18/the-essential-elements-of-tai-chi-balance-training/">Rooting, Central Equilibrium, and Balance</a>, you probably want more insight into how to put Tai Chi balance training to work in your practice.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4790" alt="MiniCover" src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MiniCover-300x231.jpg" width="300" height="231" />Now you can start Tai Chi balance training with our new eBook</strong>, "An Introduction to Rooting and Stability," where you will take the Tai Chi Way to re-gaining, one of life's simplest yet most essential treasures--<em>the gift of balance</em>.</p>
<p>The Tai Chi Balance Exercises in this course will produce a noticeable improvement in your sense of being grounded, or connected to the earth, centrally stabilized around a vertical axis, and able to change visual orientation while remaining balanced.</p>
<p>As you practice these exercises, you will begin to feel and understand the essential Tai Chi concepts of Rooting, Central Equilibrium, and Dragon Body.</p>
<p>The exercises are drawn from the more than 45 separate exercises contained in the complete Tai Chi Way to Better Balance program, which includes both an ebook and DVDs.</p>
