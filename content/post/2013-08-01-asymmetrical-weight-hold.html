This exercise also works very rapidly to give you the sense of having a strong centerline, like a tentpole with guy-wires supporting it on either side. This is the Tai Chi quality called Zhong Ding, or Central Equilibrium.<br />
In daily life we move, carry, hold, catch, and transfer objects of varying sizes and weights, and these pose a unique type of challenge to our equilibrium, as the body has to adapt to an additional weight outside itself. You will need a moderately heavy object, such as a dumbbell weight or suitcase weighing between 10 and 50 pounds.</p></p>
<ol>
<li>Stand in a parallel stance, bend from hips and knees, and lift a loaded suitcase or kettlebell or dumbbell with one hand, SLOWLY moving it from the floor (or whatever surface it rests on) to an upright standing position, with the weight as close to your body as possible. Try to stand straight, and do not lean the body either away from or on the same side as the weight.</li>
<li>Pause, standing upright, and breathe for several long breaths, trying to get your body to adjust to the weight and become as comfortable as possible. Feel your feet, your legs, your trunk, the top of your head. Become stable in an upright, balanced posture, with the added weight.<br />

<li>SLOWLY fold and lower the weight to the ground.</li>
<li>Stand and return to the parallel stance.</li>
<li>Repeat the same process with your other hand, bringing the weight to the opposite side of your body. Remember to take several breaths to accommodate the weight and stabilize your body while holding it close to you.<br />

<li>Slowly put down the weight and stand up. Note how you feel now.</li><br />
