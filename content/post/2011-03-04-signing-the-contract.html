<p>Part of playing Health Month is signing a contract to commit to follow your rules....and I was really surprised when I did it! <a id="more"></a><a id="more-672"></a>One of the things I'm thinking about while playing is how this is different from simply tracking what you eat, when you work out, and even setting goals in other areas. I didn't think it was going to be a big deal to actually sign this commitment, but it was. I have to say, I got a little nervous before I clicked on my name there. How many electronic signatures or license agreements do you sign online all the time? But this felt just a little bit different and I think that's an ingenious feature!</p>
