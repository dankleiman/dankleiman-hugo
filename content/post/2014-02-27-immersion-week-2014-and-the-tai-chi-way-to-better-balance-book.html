  content: "I find the idea of the immersion interesting- especially the Spine Stretch,
    as you mentioned previously how many people \"in standing\" find pain-discomfort
    when first beginning, so hard to begin.   \r\n      I didn't find that in Standing,
    but in Spine Stretch when I've worked with that exer- each time a shift has happened
    that has really impacted me (along with Bend the Bow- likely a result of all the
    bindings/blockages not only in my spine, but all releases in my Tissue and Energy
    seem to shift into the spine as they occur :)   anyway- be curious how the 70%
    could be applied to this (Bruce even mentioned the Intuitive sense once, of sensing
    what impact the releasing of a certain blockage could be- so that you don't \"release\"
    (sink through/dissolve, whatever) so that the impact from that is beyond one's
    70%.. seems a weird concept (how), but important..... also I wonder if any others
    react to that exer (spine releasing), or just me.     -I'm sure that will bring
    out some interesting finds.\r\n\r\n   And Congrats on the Accomplishment of the
    Book Publishing (I'm sure that was a bit of a process- let alone bringing the
    Concepts into Form to present your Ideas), and great to have from you, and with
    your co-author- good stuff.    -luck"

  content: "Thanks, Gary!\r\nIn this case, the 70% principle is really about the depth
    you are letting your awareness penetrate. When you go deeper in one spot that
    the whole is ready for, you warp the system and hit those burnout points. Blockages
    almost call us to do this, of course, so getting a feel for the whole and proceeding
    lightly/slowly through your layers is a big challenge --- one that's best learned
    by trial and error. ;-)"
