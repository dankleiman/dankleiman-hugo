  content: Excellent description and depiction of turning and leading form the waist
    (yao).  One can see in the video the use of the inner thighs and opening and closing
    of the hip gates or gua.  Inner thigh, to gua, to dan tien characterizes our closing
    moves of the Chen Pan-ling long form which was built upon the Old Yang style of
    play.  Always more similarities than differences between styles.  Thanks, Dan.

  content: Thanks, Mark! I completely agree that there's much more to learn from cross-comparison
    than most people are willing to look at.

  content: While I was working on the twisting, I began to notice that I could feel
    twisting in my upper abdomen about where the psoas might connect to the spine.  I
    paid more attention to it and found that I could initiate the twisting from this
    muscle instead of my usual practice of starting with the thigh muscles.  Felt
    much more connected and one piece.  Did the first half of the Yang 24 and found
    that it did a nice job of activating the form and then did the Wu short form and
    found that my ability to do the postures where I am 100% on one leg had become
    much more stable.  Best, Geoff

<p>When you relax into the turning of the waist and feel how it connects to the legs, you begin a process of rooting while moving that creates a dynamic and springy stability. Kind of a paradox, right?</p>
<p>You feel like a giant spring, anchored to the floor even though you're moving around, that is constantly being wound up and then released.</p>
<p>The key to cultivating this connection is how you relax through your turning, so let's start off by getting clear on what we mean when we say relaxation. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-3897"></a></p>
<p>Too often, people conflate relaxation with just slumping on the couch. In Tai Chi, we actually mean, "moving in a way that doesn't constrict your nervous system and even more, having a sense of continuously releasing the nerves as you practice."</p>
<p><a href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/03/29/qigong-radio-episode-2-developing-your-soft-tissue-with-paul-cavel/">Paul Cavel gave some great advice on the progression from turning to twisting to spiraling for Qigong Radio.</a></p>
<p>When you are relaxing into more and more leg and waist turning, your goal is to get connected all the way to the floor.</p>
<p>Here's an example:<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HolPGfI3KVc?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>In the <a href="http://dankleiman.com/tag/tai-chi-mastery-program/">Tai Chi Mastery program</a>, Bruce explains how letting this turning penetrate the legs actually protects the joints of the legs and lower spine.</strong> You must simultaneously relax the nerves and the tissue to allow for turning, but also keep space in all the joints, <em>so the turning movements pass through the joints.</em></p>
<p>Here are some of the key points to develop this quality in your practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turning from the waist should eventually feel like it directly screws the foot into the floor.</li>
<li>Turning must go through both legs in all stances.</li>
<li>Look for sections of the leg that stop turning because these freeze points will put pressure on the joints in that area (thigh or lower leg on the knee, for example, or hips/glutes on the lower spine).</li><br />
</ul><br />
You can practice this continuously in the Tai Chi form or <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/02/20/turn-the-legs-to-turn-the-body/">in a variety of other movement patterns</a>.</p>
