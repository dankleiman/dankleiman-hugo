<p>Be sure to mouse over for the original title text from the comic (Thanks, Nate!).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://xkcd.com/862/"><img class="aligncenter" title="After years of trying various methods, I broke this habit by pitting my impatience against my laziness. I decoupled the action and the neurological reward by setting up a simple 30-second delay I had to wait through, in which I couldn't do anything else, before any new page or chat client would load (and only allowed one to run at once). The urge to check all those sites magically vanished--and my 'productive' computer use was unaffected." src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/let_go.png" alt="" width="518" height="166" /></a></p></p>
