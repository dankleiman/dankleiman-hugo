excerpt: "This post is the first in a series of student practice questions that I'd
  like to answer on the blog. The question is, \"given that I know and practice several
  different qigong sets and the tai chi form, how do I organize them into a coherent
  practice?\"\r\n\r\nFor my answer, check out this video, where I will either explain
  how learning which sets to practice, in what order, is like learning to taste wine,
  or I will actually drink the bottle of wine. You'll have to watch the video to find
  out which one."
