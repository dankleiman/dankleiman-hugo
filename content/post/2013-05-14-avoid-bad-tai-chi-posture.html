  content: "The simplest way to capture it is the Finger Test. If someone placed a
    finger on the crown of your head when you do the form, would they feel a consistent,
    gentle connection up through the top of the head? If you can repeat this process
    successfully at mingmen, in the lumbar spine, then chances are pretty good that
    you are maintaining the correct spinal alignment in Tai Chi. \r\nAnother big sign
    is that the weight continuously drops down to the feet, making you feel planted
    and stable as you go through the movement changes."

  content: "Excellent post which gave me a tai chi/non-tai chi suggestion. Wear the
    right glasses at the computer, so you can maintain good seated posture and avoid
    some of those problems that come from overworking your eyes and upper body trying
    to see.\r\nAnd thinking energy gates, dissolve the eyes often if they get all
    scrunched up and hard."

  content: "Hey Bruce,\r\nYes, footwear definitely is a factor. My preference is for
    as much flexibility in the shoe as possible, with thin, flat soles that allow
    you to feel the ground as much as possible. The tradeoff is support for a lot
    of people, but ideally in your practice you're working towards support from alignments....lots
    of individual variation here depending on the \"history of your feet.\"\r\nWhat
    have you found?\r\nD"

<p>Tai Chi has the potential to solve many common posture-related problems, but only if you follow <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/02/10/the-how-what-and-why-of-tai-chi-practice/">the correct Tai Chi principles</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, you want to pay attention to the body alignments that unify the arms, legs, and spine, creating effortless openness throughout the skeletal system.</p>
<p>In Tai Chi, the way you hold your neck and head and release the pelvis into the legs are the exact opposite of what those of us who sit all day do. This is good news if you want to change your posture, but tough, because you probably spend lots of time in detrimental sitting positions each day.</p>
<p>Check out the key postural elements of Tai Chi that rectify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stiff Necks</li>
<li>Eye Strain</li>
<li>Compressed Lower Spine</li>
<li>Unstable or Weak Legs</li><br />
</ul><br />

<p>As you can see in the video, you need to constantly avoid collapsed spinal posture and find length in every movement. Obviously this can be a big challenge when you are first learning Tai Chi. Your focus initially should be on learning the movements and separately working on the fundamentals, <a title="Basic Training: Focus on Your Kwa Squat" href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/03/11/basic-training-focus-on-your-kwa-squat/">especially leg alignments and kwa squats</a>.</p>
<p>As the movement patterns become more comfortable, you can integrate healthy alignment principles, initially ignoring the details of the moves.</p>
<p><strong>For more experienced practitioners:</strong> All of the details of the movements should <em>enhance</em> the way Tai Chi opens the body by more precisely loosening the soft tissue, expanding the joints, bringing spring to the ligaments, and relaxing the nervous system. If you find that "getting it right" ever sends you away from feeling looser, stronger, and more relaxed, something's off about your practice.</p>
