  content: "Hi Dan,\r\nThanks for pointing out a good book on psychotherapy (altho
    I haven't and probably won't read the whole book--I have gotten a good overview
    of it from Amazon reviews).\r\nOn your previous topic (Transforming Conflict with
    Tai Chi) I had a minority dissenting opinion:\r\nI didn't think that one solely
    can \"bring resolution on OUTSIDE forces.\"\r\nSetting OUTSIDE against INSIDE
    is dualistic; dualism is the problem (we have met the enemy and the enemy is us).\r\nTo
    approach a problem from a dualistic viewpoint is delusion.\r\nTo accept the problem
    as part of the Self is enlightenment.\r\nSo, I did agree with you that we should
    DESIRE the problem--\r\njust as we should DESIRE a non-dualistic Self.\r\nThis
    is Buddhism:\r\n1. All is suffering (pain).\r\n2. There is an arising of pain.\r\n3.
    There is a stopping of pain.\r\n4. There is a way leading to the stopping of pain.\r\nNagarjuna's
    insight was that the \"way out\" of the cycle of pain (dualistically separating
    \ SELF and PAIN--here's me and there's pain) lay right in the middle of these
    cycles.\r\nPAIN by definition is dualistic: here's ME and there's PAIN (NOT ME,
    something that I want to get rid of/transform).\r\n\r\nI've always admired the
    practice of Tai Chi because it does not subscribe to the \"No pain, No gain\"
    strategy of training.\r\nWithout the complementary aspect of pain, your  title
    subverts this concept with the words \"DESIRE pain.\"\r\nLikewise, most reviewers
    of the Stutz/Michels book subvert the underlying \"Source\" by focusing on \"The
    Tools;\"  their Source is a Higher Authority--the non-dualistic SELF.  This SELF
    embraces both non-pain and pain/emptiness and fullness/negative and positive.
    \ \r\nBuddhists do DESIRE, they desire the Middle ground and do not attach to
    the extremes.  \r\nTo paraphrase \"The Tools:\"\r\n1. Bring it on\r\n2. I love
    pain (and non-pain)\r\n3. Pain (and non-pain) sets me free.\r\n\r\n\"The Eight
    Truths of Tai Chi\" in the Tai Chi Classics seem consistent with my view.  \r\nIn
    part they say:\r\n1. ... It is best to forget your own existence.\r\n2. ...Let
    inside and outside fuse together and become one.\r\n3. ...Learn to ignore external
    objects. ...\r\n4. ... See the ocean in its vastness ...\r\n5. ... cultivate the
    positive and the negative\r\n6. ... Your mind should be as the water and your
    spirit like the spring\r\n7. ... Make your chi like these natural wonders.\r\n8.
    ... Establish life.\r\n\r\nThe reader should explore the complete text of these
    \ \"Eight Truths of Tai Chi\"\r\nas well as the Higher Authority supporting the
    Tools--\r\nrather than emphasizing the PAIN."

  content: Bob, real enjoying your comments on this series. I'm curious to know what
    you'll make of the next one, where I try to demonstrate some of the "Tai Chi solutions"
    to these issues. Thanks for contributing!

  content: "Hi Dan,\r\nI'm not qualified to comment on Push-Hands.\r\n\r\nFor years
    I've taken workshops with sana shanti (student of Sam Masich) in Nelson B.C.\r\nBut,
    there are very few people to \"touch in\" with in northern Idaho (maybe a few
    bears).\r\n\r\nSo I never have gotten a good feel for the acid test of Push-Hands.\r\n\r\nYours
    is a nice blog on the subject.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  content: Interesting thing about water is when still it reflects everything as one.
    Apart of, not separated from. Personality doesn't get in the way. Thanks for the

<p>In response to <a title="Transforming Conflict with Tai Chi" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/09/24/transforming-conflict-with-tai-chi/">Transforming Conflict with Tai Chi</a>, many of you sent me stories of situations where you were forced into a tense encounter and you had to draw on your practice to get you through it.</p>
<p>After, you feel relief and you can move on, but sometimes the idea slips through that, "hey, I'm a little better able to handle this kind of thing because of the way I faced it."</p>
<p>What if you actually started to seek out challenging encounters because you sensed their transformative effect?</p>
<p>That is exactly what psychologists Phil Stutz and Barry Michels teach in their book, <a href="http://www.thetoolsbook.com/">The Tools,</a> and it has some surprising Tai Chi parallels.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-4205"></a><br />
Watch this short video clip about "The Reversal of Desire" which is their technique for facing pain that will move you out of your comfort zone and into new growth:<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kWZaQgDeHYM?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe><br />
Now, by itself, this is a fascinating idea, that you seek out pain as transformation. But as we discussed in the podcast, I want you to go beyond ideas and into practical, physical manifestation.</p>
<p>That's what's so exciting about your Tai Chi practice. It's not a metaphor for transformation. You're playing with the very material that will shift and change through practice.</p>
<h2>How the Reversal of Desire is like an Interactive Tai Chi Practice</h2><br />
The steps that the authors teach in their tool are very similar to the physical experience you have in Tai Chi when you neutralize your own fear response and move towards the resolution of a confrontation.</p>
<p>Here's how the tool works just like Tai Chi:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you call out to the pain, you face it. In Tai Chi, the first stage of the encounter is face-to-face and the first hurdle you have to overcome is your impulse to "freeze up" in response to the threat. The connection here is that you literally experience this freezing in the front of your body, like "a deer frozen in the headlights". Either you activate the front with enough sensitivity to pass to the second step, or you revert to the fear response, which plays out in a yin or yang way: you collapse or you tense up. The tool is similarly training your sensitivity and priming you to move into the encounter.<strong><br />
</strong></li></p>
<li>Next, you move through a cloud of pain. They want you to feel it all around you. In the Tai Chi encounter, you do something similar. You have to let the other person's energy move through you (rooting) or past you (neutralizing). In both cases, step two you are completely enveloped by the energy of the threat.</li>
<li>In the final step of the tool, you visualize being spit out by the cloud of pain and you feel it at your back. In your Tai Chi response, once you can feel your back engaged, loose, flexible, and connected to your root, you have pretty much resolved the incoming threat and your best response arises.</li><br />
</ul><br />
In both cases, stepping up to the encounter without running away and letting it wash through your system, allows you to come out the other side, engaged, connected, and ultimately stronger.</p>
<p>In both cases, you are training to allow the most natural response to arise, something you most likely hadn't planned, ruminated on, or conceived of, but that emerges because of the interaction. You get to a new place, because you have grappled with pain you would have otherwise fled.</p>
<p>The other tools in the book address different dimensions of the question, "how do I turn my challenges into courage, compassion, and creativity?" There certainly are more parallels to Tai Chi to explore. What sets <a href="http://www.thetoolsbook.com/">The Tools</a> apart is the emphasis on teaching exercises that you have to practice over and over again to build new responses. They are not after theoretical understanding, they want to cultivate an embodied response. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>What are some of the encounters you've had lately where your practice either did or did not factor in to how you resolved the situation?</p>
