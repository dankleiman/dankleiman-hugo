<p>In a recent post, we looked at <a title="5 Ways to Build Stronger Legs Using Tai Chi Exercises" href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/07/02/5-ways-to-build-stronger-legs-using-tai-chi-exercises/">5 Ways to Build Strong Legs</a>. When I posted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j34DhSHvaxo&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UU4DJ7xUL-TWEBOgDp_ekI5Q">the video to Youtube</a>, someone replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think nowadays there is a great misunderstanding of internal martial arts goals and methodology. The great issue is not to become strong but to become very weak!</blockquote><br />
Now, I think the commenter is <em>kind of</em> right, but misses a critical point, by simply reducing Tai Chi to the art of getting weaker and weaker. Just look at these Tai Chi Masters, <strong>specifically in the legs</strong>, and tell me if they seem weak:</p>

<p>There is no weakness in these Masters. You can see softness, an immense amount of relaxation, and they almost glow with internal calm. But weakness? Not here.</p>
<p>So what is the connection between the strength and the stillness they display? If you listed to last week's <a title="The Essential Elements of Tai Chi Balance Training" href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/07/18/the-essential-elements-of-tai-chi-balance-training/">Qigong Radio episode on Tai Chi for Better Balance</a>, you heard me discuss "Rooting" with Don Miller.</p>
<p>Here is a 4-minute clip from the episode, where Don specifically draws the connection between strength, stability, balance, and relaxation. When you have Tai Chi Root, you can have them all.</p>
