  content: "brilliant use of Moby Dick\r\n(Though I shouldn't be surprised; I imagine
    that \"Moby Dick\" is required reading for everyone in Massachusetts.)\r\nAlthough
    I was once a high school English teacher (Idaho) and have read \"MD\" many times,\r\nI
    don't recall having read this scene--\r\nOh, the missed opportunities.\r\nThanks

  content: "Hi Dan,\r\n\r\nThanks for your insight. \r\n\r\nYou kind of motivated
    me to get back into my standing practice. I used to just stand and didn't really
    try to do anything with my mind, with no great results. Could you please elaborate
    a little on \"the form\", the different energy gates you have to work through,
    \ if you start this 6 month period you start with the crown of the head, how much
    time do you spend on it every day, and do you just stay with the crown or do you
    always work through the whole body? I probably won't be able to stand for a very
    long time in the beginning... Thanks"

  content: "Thanks, guys!\r\n\r\nThijs, I'm going to be elaborating on the process
    more in a new post. I've been thinking about it a lot lately and want to dive
    into exactly your questions. Stay tuned. ;-)"

  content: '"the form" is simple, as Dan does in Lesson 59 of BF''s "Tai Chi Mastery
    Course"  you just have to stand in Single Whip perfectly still with relaxed awareness
    while Big Bruce rambles around you.  Ha.'

  content: "Dan, Thanks for that; yet another very helpful perspective.  I kinda feel
    like each of the perspectives I hear on the Outer Dissolving process is like another
    piece to my \"Outer dissolving puzzle\".\r\nI think Ill give your 6 month gates
    plan a try.  I wish I could be there for the workshops - \r\nnonetheless I look
    forward to absorbing more of your teaching and podcast.\r\nkev"

<p>Next month, we'll be starting a new Energy Gates course at <a title="Brookline Tai Chi" href="http://brooklinetaichi.org">Brookline Tai Chi</a>, focused on Outer Dissolving and working through the Gates of the body.</p>
<p>When you work on dissolving the gates, you will inevitably be fighting the urge to:</p>
<ul>
<li>visualize instead of feel</li>
<li>"chase" energetic releases, untethered from the physical body</li>
<li>wonder if you are really feeling anything at all</li><br />
</ul><br />
In this episode of Qigong Radio, I'll give my recommendations for avoiding these pitfalls and for <strong>setting up the conditions for actual energetic resolution</strong>.</p>
<p>If you'll indulge me, I'll even share one of my favorite passages from Moby Dick and tell you why I think it's a perfect description of standing qigong.</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
