  content: "Hello Dan,\n\nI just finished a meditation session followed by your sinking
    instruction and an energy gates set.   \n\nEasily my best sinking set yet.  Your
    instruction was easy to follow and very practical.  Your words and descriptions
    were unique and useful.  Sinking is definetly becoming a much more clear sensation
    for me.\n\nAs I went into Cloud Hands my chi felt quite strong and felt like I
    had great set.\nIm looking forward to learning more!\n\nMany Thanks,\n\nKevin
    Hartwell"

excerpt: "As you explore layers of relaxation through standing qigong, you'll hit
  a point where everything starts to feel fluid, as if you've dug down deep enough
  to find a rich aquifer, filled with nourishing water.\r\n\r\nWe describe the experience
  with words like \"sinking\" and \"soaking\" the mind into the body, and that's literally
  what's happening. Remember the qigong expression, \"your mind moves your chi and
  your chi moves your blood\"? When they say \"blood\", they mean all the fluids in
  the body. When you truly start to fuse your mind and your body, your insides start
  to feel more wet, fluid, and connected.\r\n"

<p>As you explore layers of relaxation through standing qigong, you'll hit a point where everything starts to feel fluid, as if you've dug down deep enough to find a rich aquifer, filled with nourishing water.</p>
<p>We describe the experience with words like "sinking" and "soaking" the mind into the body, and that's literally what's happening. Remember the qigong expression, "your mind moves your chi and your chi moves your blood"? When they say "blood", they mean all the fluids in the body. When you truly start to fuse your mind and your body, your insides start to feel more wet, fluid, and connected.<br />

<p>In the last lesson on standing qigong, we worked on enlivening each section of your body, bringing awareness and increased sensation to each new place, from head to toe, with <a title="Learning to Soften the Body" href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/09/26/learning-to-soften-the-body/">ten minutes of softening</a>. Now we want to move even deeper into the body and explore how you can completely refresh your system by sinking your chi.</p>
<p>Check out this guided practice session (download the mp3 below).&Acirc;  In this 20-minute scan, you'll start the process of sinking your chi by letting your mind soak into your body at each height. As you go longer now, you will begin to recognize deeper relaxation patterns and find natural resolution of holding patterns in the body, without mental force:</p>
