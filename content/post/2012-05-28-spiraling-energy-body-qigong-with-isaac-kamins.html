  content: This was my favorite episode thus far .  I know the power and effect arms
    rising postures have but to have just this introduction to the inner work is much
    appreciated.  Just the dowmward current leaves me feeling less vital than i would
    like.  I would love to hear more about this subject.  To someone who is just kinda
    exploring on their own,  is there any kind of marker or feeling that indicates
    you should move up a level in the body while dissolving upward?  When you move
    up an inch should one then go down the whole body in a generalized pass?

  content: "Thank you so much for the discussion on this subject Isaac and Dan!   It
    was good to hear an understanding of the two different flows, down and up, how
    they are developed, and their uses.  I also appreciated hearing the martial aspects
    of the practice and how it has been useful developing an awareness in the space
    between,  interacting with the surroundings, and understanding where your own
    -for the lack of a better word- \"desires\" in how you connect with others arise
    from- in the full spectrum from simply \"hitting someone\" to being generous with
    the gift of a correction.  \r\n\r\nI have one question though- and would like
    to hear more on the subject that you guys just briefly touched on- that has to
    do with the elemental energies- such as fire, water, heaven earth, etc, and how
    we feel them in our bodies- he mentions water as going down and fire as up- in
    the overall picture though, can't water go up too, all around etc?  Is the one
    direction just a starting point for each?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nBrendan"

<p>The Spiraling Energy Body Qigong set is one of the toughest in the Energy Arts system, so I asked <a href="http://watertradition.net/about.html">Energy Arts Instructor Isaac Kamins</a> to tell us about his experiences with this practice.</p>
<p>In this episode of Qigong Radio, Isaac explains how as a teenager he came to appreciate the counter-intuitive approach that the internal martial arts take to fighting and how <strong>the energetic sensitivity he has developed doing Spiraling Energy Body qigong</strong> has influenced how he interacts with other people and the world around him, far beyond the martial arts.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-3924"></a></p>
<p>Specifically, Isaac discusses how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spiraling is different from Energy Gates and I Chuan</li>
<li>The downward dissolving practice from Energy Gates prepares you to handle the upward currents of energy in Spiraling</li>
<li>You work directly with the gates in Spiraling to create more integrated, flexible, and spontaneous internal connections</li><br />
</ul><br />
Be sure to listen to the entire episode because towards the very end, Isaac gives one of the best descriptions I've heard in a long time of the way the entire Energy Arts system is designed to help you grow over time by circling back to material at ever-deeper layers.</p>
<p>As we discussed in the episode, Isaac teaches regular <a href="http://watertradition.net/home.html">Ba Gua, Tai Chi, and Qigong classes and workshops in the Bay Area</a>.</p>
