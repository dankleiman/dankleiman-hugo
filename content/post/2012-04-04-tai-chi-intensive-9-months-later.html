  content: "Thanks for putting this up!   I really enjoyed listening to this discussion
    with different people;  hearing their different voices and experiences, speaking
    about their practice, learning, and teaching. \r\n\r\n It's fascinating to hear
    about the ways teaching and practice influence each other, and also how different
    martial arts styles focus on different skills and yet can compliment each other.
    \r\n\r\nI also loved hearing about how different people integrate the material.
    \ Especially useful to me I think was the part about stabilizing the practice,
    the importance of this, understanding the smaller, basic pieces that need to be
    repeated over and over that will move you forward to the larger (for lack of a
    better word) pieces in your practice, and how this is done in ways of trying to
    move with the natural progression of the practice and your own pacing.  How we
    return over and over to the same and yet new pieces, in both a linear and non-linear
    progression.   \r\n\r\nI also found useful hearing about developing the daily
    practice mindset - such things as enjoying instead of checklisting, which is essential
    for me, and understanding and working with your resistances and limitations on
    any given day (and forgiving them too).\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\nBrendan"

  content: Yeah, Brendan. Aaron is really on to something important when he talked
    about hitting his own psychological resistance point to training after 3 or 4
    days of working the same small thing over and over. It's hard to convey in this
    format, but if you ever work with him, that principle actually comes across in
    his hands. I know that sounds weird, but you can tell he's worked it out.
