  content: "I appreciate whenever various viewpoints are collected- especially on
    NeiGung in this system (as bits and pieces need to be collected and assembled);
    these recordings are a bit like the Bagua Tele-questions recording (that I saw
    in the Bagua Mastery Promo, whatever that might be called).  Good to have this
    thx (especially as its been a few yrs since I've been able to attend any EArts
    events, although I've been studying these.\r\n\r\nTwo things I'd mention- first
    just a technical point: in these types of recordings (even by others)- there are
    different sound-volume (ie loudness) levels, and when one is speaking more quietly...
    I turn up the volume and listen and then another talks- who is being recorded
    Much Louder (especially if, as I do, one is listening via headphones)- ouch...
    back and forth... (that can be tweaked by setting up recording (-perhaps via sound
    leveling software- or edited afterward..) if not- one can deal, but would really
    add to listenability.\r\n\r\nSecondly- my understanding of Heaven&amp;Earth is
    that two aspects A) the \"squishy-fully connected\" movement, a way of introducing
    the movement quality that is all linked like a whip or wave, ie the Physical Form
    of H&amp;E, which say Cloud Hands should have also but seems to be quite difficult
    to add, while H&amp;E rise up lengthening and then \"washing\" over the head-face
    and down sort of forces the rotation in the arms/shoulders (per the palms facing
    the body &amp; the bones connection), another example I link to this is the \"smooth-form\"
    change in Bagua, but that can be done largely in the arms-shoulders- even the
    torso... without having that movement in the legs as well, while to show having
    a movement that flows through the entire body as well as giving a \"fluid-like\"
    movement (best way I can think of describing it)- this seems to be a good intro.
    \ [as opposed to G. Playing moves where there is a fluid-like spherical wave,
    but it is so subtly, being balanced in all ways- the H&amp;E Up and Down are made
    separate and distinct.  Same with Cloud Hands- to get the wave rising from the
    downward-HE/closing side (arms and leg) and expand through the upward-risingKAI/opening
    side (arms and \"rear\" leg) has that soak-wring out sloshing, but not inherent
    in the movement unless someone frees up and puts that in there).\r\n\r\nSecondly
    B) \"activating\" the Energy Gates (beyond going \"inside\" and releasing the
    Energy Gates in that practice.  In this regards I disagree with the way this is
    usually spoken of (or at least I think it could be misunderstood by those learning
    it)- in terms of the physical joint moving as a result of E-Gate activation, not
    just localized movement triggered.  (thus if that quality of \"Yang\"-KAI (opening-growing)
    vs \"Yin\"-HE (closing-shrinking) being an energetic-frequency, which changes
    in the flow of the E-gate.....    Opening the EGates, in this regards is seen
    to be (in my mind, and practice) a more internal practice than others- (although
    working \"with\" a component, is different than working \"towards- being able
    to work with\" a component; in this regards I'd put the context of how in Bruce's
    ITs he has the learning-instructors do things which may not be what one learning
    a class would do.. example the spinal-front/back ligs (anterior and posterior
    longitudinal ligaments) and the pulsing of each jt.... to be able to demonstate...
    have all strongly going, and get that part in the Instructors system enough that
    they are \"confident\" about it...thus even if the class isn't taught it, the
    instructors Body-energy is doing it... that could interpret some aspects, especially
    as many EArts ITs may be based upon most attending have some concept of much of
    what Bruce teaches, and a certain kind of person/interests attends (like Don,
    Dan and Eric mention about targeting a class to those that attend)- those at an
    EArts IT have a different understanding than those they might teach.\r\n\r\nThus
    I see A) as an intro of what this practice gives (in relation to full-body blow,
    which is also- in quite a different way in Beng-chuan, Hsing-I wood- that growing
    \"hydraulic\" feel,  and then B) being the \"internal aspect\" (but so often I
    see that aspect being external, as the Chi-Gung TuiNa can be seen as getting physical
    movement to perhaps drive some ChiGung, while the ChiGungTuiNa I've received from
    Bruce emphasizes the \"chigung\" which can result in phy-movement (energetic flow-
    some connection, some consistent flow, then changed in some way- so that flow
    then drives the subtle physical (ie fluids and CTS~ligs and intercellular mesh,
    etc.) which drives physical movment)  This second way is sustained in the system,
    and systemic (if one can first feel -be aware of, and has 'activated\" the Energy
    Gates (from that practice)- then they can be activated with a \"frequency\" that
    begins that occilation-- doing it that way -the \"pulsing\" spreads and irradiates
    other Egates quickly.\r\n      More so that the \"shrink&amp;grow\" of the jts,
    the aspect I see as a bridge into this is yin-yang meridians (just distinguishing
    those \"sides\" of torso and limbs)  and \"wrapping\" ...  if \"wrap\" around
    to the \"inside\" of the forearm (drawing from the yang-merids on back-outside
    of forearm- in) as \"sink\"-flow from fingertips down palm towards armpint...
    a strong sense of flow can be initiated, if then have wrapping to Yang (laterally)
    and then from shoulder flow out to finger tips along outside- via back of palm....
    \  that activates a certain distinct feeling, and the \"Yang and Yin Merids\"
    each have certain \"tones\" in term of feeling.. which also a step in to developing
    distinctions in a \"type of energy flow\" (more likely physical affects of subtle
    movement vs actual energy, but stepping towards that).  That was how the distinction
    was made that I recall (espec back 2001 Egates IT then the H&amp;E taught after
    that.... then change occurred, I wonder if that focus will be shifted to the Dragon&amp;Tiger
    course now?\r\n\r\n   Anyway- the quality of the movement (point A above- being
    Beng like, as well as Smooth-fluid palm- but Left-Right Balanced in movement)
    and then energetic gates-frequency (point B)- thus the gateway to the H&amp;E
    lvl2 of having the \"heaven\" quality and the \"earth\" quality brought \"into\"
    each Egate.. and contacting each... reaction (thus the \"marriage\").\r\n      thus
    the distinciton between Egates- aware of at all, them linked up (lines between,
    via Spiralling body, but a focus in ChiGungTuiNa when he did the Vancouver class,
    which stepped to the holographic aspect.. the \"Chi Body\" not being in 3d space
    of the physical body, vs a pt on the phy-body that may \"correspond\" to a particular
    chi-flow at a current time).... \"Yang merid\", \"yin merid\", \"opening-KAI\",
    \"closing-HE\", and \"heaven\"&amp;\"earth\" energies... all being qualities:
    first sense and being able to recall/consider then second be able to \"evoke\"-trigger....
    \ \r\n     (thus in bagua (8 Gua- qualities of change occuring), and HsingI (5element-
    each a quality, many expressions, that reacts-  energetically to other energies),
    and I believe TaiChi also, thus peng-an, etc. as energetic qualities triggered
    at parts of phy, that \"radiate\" in certain ways (although that isn't my practice)\r\n
    \    These are what I see H&amp;E as given access to, with what I sense being
    some of those implications (although reading all at once may make it seem a big
    stretch and complicated- foundation work and all, as well as my not being so good
    at being concise :)        \r\n                 Of course in the EArts practices
    I think there are \"cores\" and then a number of components that Bruce wants to
    have taught,, and then decide which to insert in which (as I'd heard him discuss
    the idea of having a curriculum of starting out with, XYZ and then next... with
    prerequisities, etc.  is quite different than having people attend some here and
    there, and yet still giving access points to those (in the same way that a concept
    can be taught ABC, and then say if you do ChiGung vs TaiChi health, vs TaiChi
    for push-hands-martial... how ABC would be adapted for each... and yet same core-concept).\r\n\r\nLong-respnse-my
    twocents :) thx again for assembling and presenting this.  cheers  gb"

    Hey Gary,

    So what I hear you saying is that Heaven and Earth is a great bridge between the more basic and more advanced practices? ;-)

    Just kidding, thanks for your patience on the technical side, I'm learning about that more and more.

    Really, though, you've laid out some interesting distinctions here and I think you've hit on a main issue in this system. All of the practices really are interwoven, but it's easy to get caught up in one or another and not see those connections. Some of what you've said here points the way to understanding those connections conceptually.

    Thanks for that!

  content: "I'm glad to have caught the ideas that came to me from listening to the
    above (and thus triggered what I wrote)- I'm glad you thought it was interesting
    to you also :)\r\n\r\nI guess I'm always a bit surprised when (Opening the) Energy
    Gates (of \"the\" body) and even Dragon and Tiger are said to be good introductory,
    as I think H&amp;E (whether as was previously, which some of that seems to be
    in Dr&amp;T now- or as Circling Hands) would be a good intro, as well as Gods
    Playing (which clearly seems to have alot in it, but just doing the general movements-
    without really having the alignments on, just generally the elbows to the shoulders
    and the spine-pelvis standing on the feet, and the H&amp;E or G.Playing circling
    arm moves (with or without the slight kwa-lean&amp;SQ) gets alot moving, while
    sets like E. Gates, or Bend the Bow- like TaiChi- can be done without the alignments
    and such and end up like Karate or an Aerobics (as Cloud Hands often looks like
    Cross Country skiing movement stationary, or someone in a Gym working on pulleys,
    lifting alternating sides, and swings can look like someone shaking the circulation
    back into cold hands)   .. Funny the comment you start your reply with is what
    triggered my original note in the begining--- the thought from the audios above,
    what is a good \"introductory\" set, and how to Bridge to \"more advanced\"  (especially
    as what I saw of Level 2 H&amp;E looked completely different and is a whole different
    energetic-game, which Bruce mentioned he conceived of 5 levels.. so what else?)\r\n
    \      always the question I have when I'll figure some part of it out- so that
    I can start \"practicing\" (without it constantly changing- developing, \"back
    to the drawingboard\" on my putting it all together) :)\r\n\r\nthx for exchanging
    thoughts  (I wanted to mention this site is pretty neat, I only saw it a month
    or so ago, from a link on the EArts Forum that you posted, just as I found this
    page from a diff EArts post you made :)  best wishes to you and yours"

  content: "Thanks, Gary! \r\nWe experimented with Gods as an intro set for a while
    at Brookline Tai Chi, just focusing on the basic movements. I think it worked
    well for some people. Elements of it, with the big circles as you say, can certainly
    be useful, even as an introduction to Tai Chi, to get the sense of smoothness
    and flow that circularity brings. \r\n\r\nI always try to watch out for the trap
    of  \"now that I have some experience, I know what would be a better way for a
    beginner to learn\" -- that's not how I learned! ;-)"

<h2>Heaven and Earth Circa 1982</h2><br />
When Energy Arts Senior Instructor Eric Peters first learned this exercise from Bruce Frantzis in 1982, it was simply known as the "wood exercise". Eric explains why and describes the seasonal intensives that they would do to harness the energy of the 5 Elements.</p>

<h2>Heaven and Earth in the Energy Arts Curriculum</h2><br />
Next, we discuss the role Heaven and Earth plays in the entire Energy Arts system. What skills do you build from Heaven and Earth? How does it open your body and develop your energy?</p>
<p><object width="420" height="315" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/eCXePTL2HvA?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="420" height="315" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/eCXePTL2HvA?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<h2>Heaven and Earth as the Bridge to More Advanced Practice</h2><br />
We discuss why Heaven and Earth is considered a bridge between the basic practices and more advanced practices, including the way it gives you greater access to "internal" movement, how you develop a particular quality of mind, and the way that opening and closing is fundamental to all 16 neigong.</p>
<p><object width="420" height="315" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/gl_Ec7Zh1wY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="420" height="315" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/gl_Ec7Zh1wY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<h2>What Students Experience Learning Heaven and Earth for the First Time</h2><br />
This clip is a little longer, but it's worth watching. Each of the instructors discuss what it has been like for their students to work with some of the pretty strange new ways you use your body in Heaven and Earth.</p>
<p><object width="420" height="315" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/7mOdxOv8G_Y?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="420" height="315" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/7mOdxOv8G_Y?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<h2>Microcosmic and Macrocosmic Orbits</h2><br />
In the last clip, we touch on some technical details about the microcosmic and macrocosmic orbits, two energetic pathways that are utilized in many different qigong sets. While they are central to Heaven and Earth, Eric explains the best way to work with them without getting confused or side-tracked.</p>
