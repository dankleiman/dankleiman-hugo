  content: Very interesting discussion. It is nice to hear that science is now supporting
    much of the knowledge practitioners "knew" but had a hard time getting others
    to believe and/or understand.

  content: Great QR about how qigong practice can increase our focus and attention
    inside the sensing/ feeling body (not visualizing). Great to come present and
    bypass the history/ thinking mind.  Great Radio. Thanks!

  content: I would just like to comment on the fact that Cathy does not define what
    &laquo;mind&raquo; is.  Can the mind be embodied?  What is the relationship of
    mind and brain (brain being an integral part of the body).  She implies that the
    mind is out there but not in the body since she trying to bring the mind in the
    body. This gives the impression that mind and body are two separate entities?  Is
    it too simplistic to merely say that the brain creates the mind (and thus the
    mind cannot be out there). Or can we safely say that the mind activates the brain?
    Food for thought. Thanks!

  content: It seems that there is a lot of relationship here between how the Russians
    used visualization to improve their Olympic athletes performance many years ago
    and Neuro linguistic Programing developed by Bandler.
