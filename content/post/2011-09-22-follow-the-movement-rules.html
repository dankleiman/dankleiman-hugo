  content: Dan-one of the inner rhythms that you can synchronize practice with is
    the wave in the cerebrospinal fluid.  It can have several different rates--the
    easiest to find is about a one and two and three and four beat, but there is a
    longer one that can be more than 10 seconds.  One of the easier ways to feel the
    pulse of the wave is to feel how two of the major bones of the skull--the occipital
    bone at the back and the sphenoid bone in the front work as a hinge.  As the spine
    rises, these two hinge towards each other and draw fluid up into the ventricles
    of the brain; as they release and fall down, they release fluid down towards the
    pelvis.  Worth trying.  Learned how to feel these rhythms in a workshop on craniosacral
    therapy.  Best, Geoff

<p>Check out the updated <a title="Code of Practice" href="http://dankleiman.com/code-of-practice/">"Code of Practice"</a>. These are the rules you need to follow to make sure your practice is energizing, nourishing and rewarding in the long run. You must follow these rules 100% to the letter, unless you think that kind of rigidity violates either #2 and/or&Acirc;  #4.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think. Did I miss anything?</p>
