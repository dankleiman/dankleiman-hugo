  content: "I bet one of the reasons that historically armies were trained to marched
    in straight lines...they didn't want the lower ranks to think!  I was drafted
    into the Vietnam War and can tell you we marched endless numbers of miles during
    training, usually in straight lines. I've also read the so-called esoteric reason
    soldiers are taught to begin marching on their left foot (left, right, left, right...!)
    is that starting with the right would engage the thinking more.  I guess the elite
    groups (Delta Force, etc.) are taught to think and strategize in the field...they
    move according to what the terrain and circumstance ask of them.\r\nThanks for
    bringing this up...it's really good to know about.  I think it's important for
    school teachers to know too."

  content: Interesting, Tom! Bruce has said something similar about posture and straight/rigid
    alignments vs springy and flowing.

  content: Hey Dan, Awesome webinar. Yes, you gave a lot of info.  I am glad to hear
    (via Bill)  "body moves chi moves mind." as well as "mind moves chi moves blood
    (body)" Great for us body based folks.  I'm really glad that I got the bit of
    chance to study with Bruce and you and Bill when I could. And your webinars keep
    me connected with this powerful system and deepen my understanding and practice.
    Best to you and your integration at Brookline...

excerpt: "One of the most fascinating connections between your mind and your body
  is the way that the actual physical movements that you make affect your awareness.\r\n\r\nWhen
  your movements are linear and jerky, your mind stops and starts too, essentially
  gapping out.\r\n\r\nIf you can move in a smooth circular way, your mind tends to
  stay calmer too. Or at least, you can calm your mind through circular movement.\r\n\r\nThe
  next level of \"smooth\", though, is spherical movement. That's the specialty of
  Gods Playing in the Clouds Qigong."

<p>One of the most fascinating connections between your mind and your body is the way that the actual physical movements that you make affect your awareness.</p>
<p>When your movements are linear and jerky, your mind stops and starts too, essentially gapping out.</p>
<p>If you can move in a smooth circular way, your mind tends to stay calmer too. Or at least, you can calm your mind through circular movement.</p>
<p>The next level of "smooth", though, is spherical movement. That's the specialty of Gods Playing in the Clouds Qigong.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-3791"></a><br />
Next session, at Brookline Tai Chi, we will begin to work on Gods again. Here's what we'll be focusing on:</p>
<p><object width="420" height="315" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/WLlgMDqFW4I?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="420" height="315" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/WLlgMDqFW4I?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>To prepare for this shift from Heaven and Earth to Gods, and more generally, unpack the concept of straight lines, circles, and spheres, <strong>I'm holding a free online class on Thursday, April 19 from 12 to 1pm, EDT.</strong> </p>
