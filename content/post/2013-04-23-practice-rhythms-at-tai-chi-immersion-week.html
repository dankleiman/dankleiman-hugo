<p>Here is my mid-week update from Tai Chi Immersion Week 2013 at <a title="Brookline Tai Chi" href="http://dankleiman.com/tag/brookline-tai-chi/">Brookline Tai Chi</a>.</p>
<p>It's pretty cool to see folks come from all over to train for a week, but you really have to have the right mind set to make the most of the format.</p>
<p>See what I mean here:</p>

<p>When you practice, be sure to include a clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warm-up: </strong>where you settle in and transition from the rest of your day.</li>
<li><strong>Ramp-up:</strong> where the real "training" happens and you work on specific attributes of your practice.</li>
<li><strong>Integration period:</strong> where you don't try to do anything new, but let the work from the ramp-up period settle down.</li>
<li><strong>Buffer:</strong> where, without making an abrupt shift, you transition back into the rest of your day.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Whether you practice for <a title="Sinking Your Mind through Your Body" href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/10/03/sinking-your-mind-through-your-body/">20 minutes</a> or <a title="Practice Twice a Day" href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/09/01/practice-twice-a-day/">twice a day for a week</a>, if you look for these rhythms, you will build more energy and deepen your Tai Chi practice.</p>
