  content: "Hi Dan,\r\nGreat vid, I signed up for the More Energy emails, want to
    check it out.\r\nSorting through the Standing and Dissolving process is a journey
    for sure. Your suggestions are good and your approach seems right on to me. Having
    the direct experience is the goal of the instructions. Once you can experience
    Dissolving to one degree or another, it teaches you. Until then you need the teachings
    to find it. Having someone guide you step by step is valuable, I had to hear it
    like a hundred times before I could stay patient enough to guide myself down the
    whole body.  For me I can always return to Dissolving and benefit from it. Combining
    it first in the Energy Gates set and later in Ba Gua Circle Walking and Xing Yi
    San Ti is the way to go. The more you can do it moving, I feel it strengthens
    the standing tremendously.  At times I like to alternate between Standing and
    Cloud Hands suddenly and seamlessly to try and carry over the meditative state
    from one to the other. Kind of to trick my body/mind into thinking it's still
    standing as you move a few times before it can catch up. Then back to standing
    once it gets used to the rhythm of the Cloud Hands. -J"

<p>In this video, we're talking about building up the skill of Outer Dissolving in your standing qigong practice.</p>
<p>When you start out, it pays to follow a recipe - a set of instructions that lead through a certain procedure physically, energetically, and with your mind. </p>
<p>However, there are times you want to break away from the recipe and times you'll want to reflect on your experience verbally -- but there are good and bad ways to do both.</p>
