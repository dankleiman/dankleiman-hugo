excerpt: "<img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-3729\" title=\"QigongRadio300\" src=\"http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/QigongRadio300.jpg\"
  alt=\"\" width=\"210\" height=\"210\" />In episode 2 of Qigong Radio, I sat down
  with Energy Arts Senior Instructor Paul Cavel to discuss what it feels like to work
  with soft tissue -- muscle, fascia, and ligaments -- in the internal arts.\r\n\r\nWe
  discussed the different stages of practice and one of my favorite topics: adopting
  the right mindset so that the progress you make in your body isn't outpaced by what
  you think you're doing in your mind.\r\n\r\nI think you'll appreciate the clarity
  of Paul's explanations and I want you to know that this topic is a direct reply
  to feedback I received on <a title=\"The Marriage of Heaven and Earth Qigong\" href=\"http://dankleiman.com/2012/02/15/the-marriage-of-heaven-and-earth-qigong/\">Episode
  1, about the Marriage of Heaven and Earth</a>. "
