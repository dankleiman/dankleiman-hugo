  my whole qigong world changed. Let me tell you how.

Or I should say, from watching my wife make magic in the kitchen! If you saw us cooking together, you'd see her doing everything right and me doing everything wrong. When I started to practice qigong the way she cooks, my whole qigong world changed. Let me tell you how.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-1725"></a></p>
<p><strong>What I do:</strong> I read every recipe word for word and line by line.</p>
<p><strong>What she does: </strong>She reads recipes like poetry and gets layers of meaning from the whole thing.</p>
<p><em><strong>Qigong Lesson: </strong>At first, you need to learn your forms and the basics of your qigong set, but eventually, you have to get a feel for the whole, or you'll never get truly energized from the practice.</em><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What I do: </strong>I race back and forth from the counter to the cook book, thinking, "was that a lemon or a lime?"<em></em><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What she does: </strong>She stops and imagines a taste, thinking "what kind of citrus will compliment these other ingredients? Maybe I'll use an orange instead"....and she's usually right!<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Qigong Lesson: </strong>You need to develop a feel for your energy flows so that you know what kind of practicing you need to do on any given day or any time of day. </em><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What I do: </strong>I freak out when the timer goes off, because the recipe said 10 minutes, but it's been 12 or 13 and I can't tell if it's done yet.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>What she does: </strong>The recipe calls for a specific cook-time? She knows those are vague guidelines and she'll sniff, pinch, or push on the food to know exactly when it's ready.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Qigong Lesson: </strong>The exercises you practice all have prescribed times and reps, but they're just there so that you learn what "done" feels like energetically.</em><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>So, if you want your qigong practice to be as nourishing as a delicious, healthy meal, practice like my wife cooks: go a few layers deeper than your thinking mind and access your intuition. Learn to practice by feel. Otherwise, your practice will always be like reading out of a cookbook. When was the last time you got full from reading a recipe?</p>
