<p>The eyes are the gateway to your nervous system.</p>
<p>This is a theme that my teacher <a title="Bruce Frantzis" href="http://dankleiman.com/bruce-frantzis/">Bruce Frantzis</a> weaves into many different Tai Chi and qigong teachings that he gives.</p>
<p>Relaxing the nervous system is one of the central goals of Tai Chi practice. With a relaxed nervous system you are more aware of your reactions, thoughts, emotions, and really, your entire internal environment.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-3974"></a></p>
<p>One of the best ways to begin to tune into the state of your nervous system is by learning to feel your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Relaxing Your Eyes in Tai Chi:</strong></p>

<p>We did an expanded lesson on this same technique, using partners, at the <a href="http://www.dankleiman.com/tag/wsfit2011/">Wu Short Form Instructor training</a>, so I hope this practice is also included in the <a href="http://dankleiman.com/tag/tai-chi-mastery-program/">Tai Chi Mastery Program</a>.</p>
<p>Use the "eye-check" as a way to start your practice each day, then as a periodic check during your practice session.</p>
<p>Are you too focused on getting something right? Your eyes will tense up.</p>
<p>Have you found your root and maintained nice, sinking energy throughout? You'll keep your soft eyes.</p>
<p>Here's to relaxed practicing!</p>
