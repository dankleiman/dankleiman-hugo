<p>I'm sure I'll have more to say about this work in the future, but we've just done a series of demos this fall highlighting the expanding role of evidence-based Tai Chi programs as public health interventions. When you look at the cost of a fall for older adults (I've heard figures like $20,000) and the good evidence that Tai Chi can reduce falls and fear of falling (now considered a risk factor for falling), it makes so much sense to fund Tai Chi classes all over: senior centers, assisted living facilities, community centers.</p>
<p>Check out video from a recent demo I did in Worcester. I didn't know the Home Care Alliance camera was rolling!</p>
