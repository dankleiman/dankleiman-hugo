  content: "Dan,\r\nDo I get it right that in the beginning it is OK to stick the
    butt out, but eventually we want the pelvis drop during bend / sitting down so
    that the lumbar spine gets elongated? Shoud we intentially tuck in the pelvis
    or just relax it while sitting down?"

  content: I'm biased towards not forcing the tuck in the beginning...you want to
    have a clear sense of where the fold (and eventually hollow) comes from, so less
    precision with the tailbone is ok at first. Otherwise, you tend to tense and hold
    in all the wrong places to try to make that happen.

  content: "Thanks Dan,\r\nBending and stretching from the kwa?\r\nI'll be darned
    if I can figure any of this out.\r\n(And it isn't because I haven't tried, or
    that Bruce's or your descriptions are ambiguous).\r\n\r\nStretch = relax = exhale
    = open =  store?\r\nBend = contract = inhale = close = release?\r\n\r\n(Shui)
    Sink Qi: relax, allow, stretch, joints open\r\n(Song) Store Qi\r\n(Fa) Release
    Qi: contract, bend, close\r\n\r\nSo, I'm standing here with my heels together,
    weight 50-50 on both legs.\r\nI want to move my left foot laterally a half of
    a step to the left--to the opening position.\r\nI will need to get 100% of my
    weight on to my right leg (at least in a tai chi way).\r\nHow do I do that?\r\n\r\nInitially,
    do I stretch the right leg or bend it (stretch the kwa or bend the kwa)?\r\n(I
    think I want the qi to run down my right leg, store it in the root, and let it
    rebound up the right leg to energize the left leg to move laterally to the left--effortlessly)\r\n\r\n\"Stretching\"
    muscle is allowing the sliding elongation of overlapping protein fibers.\r\nAs
    these sarcomeres elongate  energy is stored.\r\nAs a rubber band is stretching,
    energy potential is building up.\r\n\r\n\"Bending\" contracts the muscle, sacromeres
    are shortened and energy is expended.\r\nWhen the stretched rubber band is released
    it snaps back to its resting position (POW!)\r\n\r\nOf course, in real-time muscles
    work in pairs--antagonist with protagonist.\r\nMaybe we should simplify the problem
    by only considering the muscles of the groin (kwa).\r\n(I guess that when groin
    muscles are bent, butt muscles are stretched.)\r\n\r\nIf we bend the kwa, joints
    close and Qi doesn't flow so nice.\r\n\r\nSo we would need to stretch the kwa
    initially to start the qi running down towards the foot.\r\nWe have to relax the
    kwa (shui)--but not bend it--let it stretch?\r\n(to let go is to relax, I'm exhaling--diaphragm
    is also relaxing--I'm \"falling asleep\"--but not collapsing)\r\n\r\nSo, Yin and
    Yang analysis:\r\nIn down there must be up.\r\nKwa is stretching up--qi is flowing
    down.\r\n\r\nThis is rather difficult for me to experience.\r\nMakes me wonder
    if I have any clue about tai chi.\r\n\r\nNo need to respond--\r\nby writing about
    it I'm hoping to get enlightened.\r\n\r\nBut I really like Bruce's forward bending
    Wu style, tailbone tucking Brush-Knee-Twist.\r\nIt really does \"stretch\" and
    relax those chronically tight lower back muscles.\r\nIf it works, don't knock
    it, eh?"

  content: "Hey Bob,\r\n\r\nI guess I would make the distinction that we first think
    about moving from the joints (ignoring muscle movements other than trying to relax
    them as much as possible). So you can \"circle\" the joints -- think ball and
    socket rotation -- or \"fold\" the joints -- think elbow flexion. This is the
    most basic way of moving. \r\n\r\n\"Bending and Stretching\" is the next level
    where you actively engage the soft tissue. I've never tried it, but now that I
    think about it, it's kind of like wearing heavy clothing that is soaked through
    with warm water. Every micro movement gently pulls on everything else. \r\n\r\n\"Opening
    and Closing\" gets activated in the joints and cavities -- and whole body really
    -- as the bend and stretch work goes deeper into your system. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't
    focus on the one-to-one correspondences so much. Hope that helps!"

  content: "I've heard the folding of the qwa being in two different planes.  Horizontal
    (cloud hands) or verticle (squat)\r\nIf one is working toward the opening and
    closing is there a preferred order .  In attempting these eventually wouldn't
    \ the horizontal softness want to transferred to the more demanding squat.  Or
    does the squat get the spacing and alignment of the joints to where one can then
    relax into the bend and stretch/opening.  I'm always wrestling with this one and
    while the squat seems more challenging to keep together it is also harder to relax
    the soft tissue."

  content: So maye a good sequence for finding a soft squat where one can focus on
    the bending and stretching would be (assuming one has experience standing and
    sinking).  A spine stretch  (sinking thoroughly through legs) cloud hands ( no
    arms concentrating only on folding the kwa) then circling hands.

  content: "Thanks again Dan,\r\nVery good suggestion about focusing more on the joints.\r\nMy
    biggest problem is over-thinking these things.\r\n\r\nFor bagua, I'm trying to
    get how to twist soft tissue (same issues in taiji).\r\nMy problem at this point
    in my development, is that I can feel how my big muscles contract and relax,\r\nbut
    I cannot feel how my soft tissue is twisting.\r\nBruce writes that twisting is
    very different from contracting and releasing muscles.\r\n\"In fact, if you contract
    and release muscles, you will inhibit your ability to twist them,\" he says.\r\n\r\nThis
    is why your suggestion to primarily focus on the joints opening and closing is
    helpful.\r\n\r\nI think Andrew's question is interesting, too.\r\nIt's here that
    I have a problem with the big muscles.\r\nI think that a muscle has to be RELAXED
    to stretch.\r\nMuscles work in antagonist pairs.\r\nFor example, when the biceps
    of the upper arm are contracting, the triceps are relaxed. \r\n(lower arm flexes/pulls/bends
    toward the upper arm.)\r\nYou might say just to think of the elbow joint as closing.\r\n(Can
    you really open and close the elbow joint just by twisting soft tissue, without
    muscle pull?)\r\n\r\nSo, on the vertical plane, the vertical flexing of the hip--femur
    raising towards the torso (when the torso is fixed) is caused by contraction of
    the psoas muscles (gluts are stretching and relaxed--I guess).\r\nYou might say
    just to think of the hip joint closing.\r\n(If the leg is fixed, the torso will
    be pulled down to leg by that same contracting psoas muscle).\r\n\r\nAnother example
    of antagonistic pairs; abductor and adductor muscles.\r\nThese are the muscle
    groups involved in the horizontal plane.\r\nSo adductors are pulling the leg away
    from the torso.\r\n\r\nNone of this seems to be relevant to the twisting of soft
    tissue around the hip joint when folding or opening the kwa.\r\nSo, I'll let Dan
    answer Andrew."

  content: This squat issue is a great reason for me to get back into my dragon and
    tiger practice.  I have th idea that underneath the verticle movement of the qwa
    squat  is complex twisting going on.  dragon and together let's that twisting
    be natural as possible while possibly moving from a verticle (bend forward) fold
    to a squating movement concentrating on one side at a time.

  content: "Hello all- my understanding of this work from Bruce and my own practice
    often reflects on these issues.   In above it seems that some elements are being
    combined/confused, that are separate (all the NeiGung components can each be done
    indiv, and then can be matched up together in different combos: as the ex of a
    \"mixing board\" in a sound studio ie an Equilizaer, many different \"level-knobs\"
    \ raising and lower in diff ratio-patterns... while in training development, certain
    relationships are easier, but once learned (distinction between learning and beingabletodo)\r\n\r\n
    \ Related to that- what I term Folding and Unfolding (ie the frame, for ex fold-
    arm straight fold at the elbow so hand is nearer to shoulder- unfold hand moves
    away from should and thus elbow unfolds)..  that can be an Open-Close of the \"Cavity\"~pocket
    near the Elbow-jt   (related but not the same)  And open-close the elbow      Think
    of pockets near the jt vs pocket \"inside\" the jt (as well as open-close in area
    not near jts, and Ultimately OpenClose is energetic and has nothing to do with
    physical... for a Jt or another area to get larger or smaller- like \"oull on
    it\" to \"Outwardly Make it pulse\" is not OpenClose... getting the EnergyGate
    (EGate) to Pulse is openclose... which may as a consequence drive physical expression.\r\n\r\n
    \   Bend and Stretch is different from the above (but as in the first part of
    my comment- it can and is combined with... and as in the video by Dan, \"learning
    how to\" Bend and Stretch is distinct from what that NeiGung component is \"once
    you can do it\"     [Bend the (Yin) and Stretch the (Yang) - relates to the AcuMeridians
    and flow along the Fascia... not really \"lengthening\"  but Lengthening isn't
    just Agonist Antagonist- its like a rubber band..   \r\n\r\n   Other piece on
    Kwa- as Dan taught in another video- and Key concepts from Bruce (as referenced
    in books mentioned above) there is Kwa horizontal LeftandRight, vs \"vertical
    \"UpandDown- then there is a Circle (both the first two- so even if LeftandRight
    without bobbing up and down, like in CloudHands.... In CouldHands it should still
    be a Circle with left-right-upAndDown.. (just the Up-Down movement is small- but
    it is a fully-filled out shape as it moves- like a \"jellyfish\")\r\n     And
    then there is a Sphere (a jump up from circle, which is a jump up from the first
    two)-- each of those 3 jumps- becomes more \"alive\" and it reacts and moves,
    vs something you \"make happen\".\r\n\r\n    In relation to the issue of HipJts-
    I myself, and as Bruce used to mention more in the past, about the Healing crisis,
    but also so major as if integrate \"standing up- sitting down- moving between
    (~SQ), Stepping and walking.. breathing... link in NeiGung to those things...
    we are always doing them.. then it starts to happen ongoing (vs a \"practice session\"
    dont do.. not benefit- vs link into an ongoing \"generator\")\r\n\r\nI hope that
    adds something- good luck\r\n\r\nps - the note about Dr&amp;T (and other sets
    as well) doing, and then seeing what it sets up in your system- not \"causing\"
    XYZ.. but what is embedded within the ChiGung Set  (like Dr&amp;T, not taught
    to have spiralling, let along twisting, or even really a focus on \"relax\" and
    let go- rather the motion is done, and what Isn't needed is stopped- and the underlying
    \"twisting\" rotational Bone movements- \r\n\r\n   once the tissue is \"released\"
    it can be felt... it is a new feeling... if look for what you expect and have
    felt betfore- it will only be what you already Know."

    inside of as \"fold\" can be Bend, and \"unfold\" can be Bend (which I think of
    like bending wire- bend to an angle, or bend back straight, and Stretch- can be
    stretched fold, and stretched unfold..  as ex, although not all of it, feel the
    ligs and other connective tissue (tendons, fascial layers) stretch during both
    parts of the move)...   and Yin and Yang not just the quals, but within the WeiChi
    (accupts, myofascial layer just below the skin)... ties to Peng and An quals in

<p>Every six months or so, one of our Senior Instructors at Brookline Tai Chi tells me that he's had an amazing revelation about how to do the kwa squat.</p>
<p>The kwa squat is one of the very first things we teach, he's been doing Tai Chi for 40 years, and he gets new insight into it all the time. Amazing, right?</p>
<h2>Tai Chi and Back Pain</h2><br />
One of the reasons we get so interested in this exercise is its power to relieve pressure on the spine and open up important joints of the body.</p>
<p>Here, our teacher <a title="Bruce Frantzis Tai Chi Resources" href="http://dankleiman.com/bruce-frantzis-tai-chi-resources/">Bruce Frantzis</a> explains how Tai Chi works on the spine, including the effects of squatting, tucking, <a title="My Favorite Breathing Hack" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/01/30/my-favorite-breathing-hack/">breathing</a>, <a title="Sinking Your Mind through Your Body" href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/10/03/sinking-your-mind-through-your-body/">sinking your chi</a>, and <a title="Bend the Bow Spinal Qigong" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/11/12/bend-the-bow-spinal-qigong/">Bend the Bow</a> techniques done in Tai Chi.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OA6ao4UyiiA?rel=0" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Even though there are many different ways to open the spine in Tai Chi, let's focus on one of the core: <strong>the kwa squat</strong>.</p>
<p>There's a saying in Tai Chi, which surely applies to all arts, that "high level skill is just high level basics." The deeper you go with the fundamentals, the better you get. So let's revisit the basics of the kwa squat. Specifically, we'll look at how this leads to a healthier spine and integrates the body.</p>
<h2>The Kwa Squat</h2><br />
The first three levels of using the kwa will get you in the game for the more sophisticated variations you use in Tai Chi. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Folding the kwa</li>
<li>Bending and Stretching from the kwa</li>
<li>Pump the kwa</li><br />
</ol><br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gevaFsGiYg0?rel=0" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Because we're not really a squatting culture in the West, most people have a steep motor-learning curve when they try their first kwa squat.</p>
<p>Our hips tend to be frozen and we'll jam into the knees to try to lower the body.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-946 aligncenter" alt="Downward Phase of Squat" src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/squat-down-300x215.jpg" width="300" height="215" /></p><br />
In a proper squat,  the hip joint (green dot) moves back and down, while the knee joint (red dot), rotates in place. You can also track the femur movement (white line). <em>The knee doesn't move forward in space.</em></p>
<p>You can get a feel for the basic version by placing your knees up against the seat of a chair. When you squat, the chair shouldn't move at all. If you press into the chair, you are pressing into your knees.</p>
<p>Instead, you will probably feel like you're sticking your butt out. That's a good thing for this exercise and it will lead us to a key difference between a Tai Chi kwa squat and the kind of squat you would use to lift heavy weight, like in a deadlift.</p>
<p>In a Tai Chi kwa squat, you keep the spine straight, so the pelvis hangs like an anchor from the bottom of the spine. One of the reasons this is done is to create more space in the lumbar spine. As your sensitivity and control increase in this exercise, you can even begin to use the pulsing of the kwa to create a gentle opening at the sacroiliac joint.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="source: Wikipedia" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Sacroiliac_joint.svg/500px-Sacroiliac_joint.svg.png" width="250" height="188" /></p><br />
Opening the sacroiliac joint makes the connection between the legs and spine much stronger, increases overall flexibility in the hips, and makes your movements much smoother.</p>
<p>In the process of developing this fine motor control, you need to pass through several levels of releasing and relaxing muscles and coordination. For more practice ideas, you might want to review these posts:</p>

</ul><br />
If you focus on developing this core skill, all the other qigong and Tai Chi movements that you learn are designed to multiply out the benefits. If you skip over the basics, though, the other movements just become fancy hand-waiving. Always revisit your basic training!</p>
