  content: Thank you for this video. I work full time with people who experience anxiety
    and depression at a clinical level. I am sadly disappointed by the lack of effort
    within the Energyarts community to connect with people who seriously need our
    help. These people are not middle class americans, cannot afford the price of
    classes, let alone retreats.  All of the photos and videos of retreats show wealthy
    white people smiling for their good fortune yet unconscious of their privilege.
    I have studied internal arts for over 30 years, 20 of them with BK Frantzis. I
    have worked with people who have been given diagnosis of serious mental illness,
    for over ten years AND I have been "advised" that I should not use energyarts
    methods when working with these self-same people. Your video may be a chink in
    their armour... When I graduated with a Masters in Clinical and Mental Health
    Counseling I was advised to be annoying, loud and vociferous in my support of
    those unable to defend themselves. I am...

  content: Derek, what do you make of the perceived caveats around doing this work?
    I often thought it had more to do with the experience of the instructor, i.e.
    folks like you and Dorothy who have proper training can bring the practices into
    a clinical setting. I would feel irresponsible if I did that, the same way it's
    always tricky territory when we tout health benefits....not really a medical context.

  content: "Thank you Dan. I am very pleased that you took the time to respond and
    I totally agree with you. Great care should be taken when working with people
    who have received a diagnosis of some kind of emotional and/or mental illness
    or any medical illness come to that. If we consider that over one quarter of Americans
    suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year, then the same is true
    when working with almost anyone. This is dependent on whether we agree with the
    diagnosis of mental illnesses.\r\n\r\nPlease see: \r\nhttp://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-numbers-count-mental-disorders-in-america/index.shtml\r\nhttp://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2010/reducing-disparities-in-mental-health-equity-closing-the-gaps.shtml\r\n\r\nIn
    mental health communities I have found that I work with African American students
    most of the time. Interestingly enough, this is not true at Boston University
    Center for Psych Rehab, where most students are white. Our mental, medical and
    educational systems appear to be basically racist and I am very disappointed when
    ever and where ever I witness this personally.  \r\n\r\nThank you again Dan\r\n\r\nPost
    Script: Thank you for all your work via dankleiman.com of which I am an avid reader.
    The Dissolving tracks have been a real treat."

  content: "That's a great point about the numbers, Derek.\n\nAgain, in reference
    to physical conditions, I've always tried to be clear that in a group class setting
    with my limited knowledge/training, there's only so much I can do for people.
    \n\nI would be really curious to hear anything you were comfortable sharing about
    a direction or guidelines you've observed for implementing these practices in
    a clinical setting."

  content: "Derek and Dan,\r\nI'm so glad you're engaging in this conversation. I'm
    a somatic psychotherapist and have been practicing Bruce's work for nearly 20
    years and teaching it for around 15.\r\nIt would be amazing to get this work to
    people with more severe \"clinical\" issues - while yet it does require some expertise
    of the population you're working with. A big issue is many people with severe
    psychological disorders are highly traumatized - either from obvious trauma (trauma
    with a big T), developmental trauma (the smaller day to day occurrences that take
    their toll on the child's psyche and nervous system), as well as the high internal
    stress that gets generated if there's an \"organic\" disorder. The beginning stages
    of Bruce's work emphasize relaxation - which is fabulous. BUT - relaxing for those
    with trauma responses embedded in their nervous systems could inadvertently wake
    up a pandora's box of incredible proportions.\r\nI think the trick would be how
    to get psych-based professionals to be compelled to study this work and begin
    integrating it into their practice. I've been doing that for 15 years and seen
    it help trauma, anxiety, panic disorder, depression, and even borderline personality
    disorder. Again, this is in the context of one-on-one or small group therapy.\r\nIt
    would be great if we could find a way to start offering CEU trainings to health
    professionals. That would be a great foot in the door.\r\nDerek - I'm currently
    airing a free telesummit on holistic methods for anxiety and depression\r\nhttp://theembodiedsoulcentertrainingseries1.com/\r\n\r\nCheck
    it out as soon as you can while Steve Hoskinson's (Somatic Experiencing) and Claudia
    Sinay-Mosias (an incredible overview of the medicalization of psychological \"disorders\"
    and her take on anxiety - it's an absolutely awesome talk) are still airing.\r\n\r\nI
    prerecorded an interview with Dan on the very topic of chi gung and tai chi for
    anxiety and depression that will begin airing on Tuesday. You may really enjoy
    it. It doesn't address those with more severe levels of disturbance - mostly out
    of respect because I don't think it can be talked about lightly.\r\nI think the
    trick is, the more we can make it compelling to the health care professionals,
    the more we can hopefully filter it in to those who can benefit. I know a lot
    of awesome practitioners working on the \"frontline\".\r\nBlessings!\r\nDorothy"

  content: "Dorothy,\r\nThank you SO MUCH for this specific caveat regarding relaxation
    work for people w/ bit T &amp; little t trauma:\r\n\"The beginning stages of Bruce's
    work emphasize relaxation - which is fabulous. BUT - relaxing for those with trauma
    responses embedded in their nervous systems could inadvertently wake up a pandora's
    box of incredible proportions.\"\r\n\r\nI've spent my career in education.  Currently,
    it's becoming quite popular to start classes w/ \"relaxation techniques,\" particularly
    for classes that seek to foster deep, critical thinking &amp; transformational
    learning.  Yet, very little - or more accurately, NO - consideration is given
    to what these techniques might trigger or as you so beautiful put it \"inadvertently
    wake up.\"   From something as simple as a flashback or a pandora's box.  Unfortunately,
    both the teacher &amp; the student are left ill-equipped w/ what to do next.\r\n\r\nWe
    need to explore &amp; discuss when &amp; how to use these techniques, and to always
    remember the lived lives of the people who are coming to our classroom, sessions,
    etc., and to honor those above everything else!  Thank you for making this point
    so clearly!"

  content: "Hi Dorothy &amp; Dan, \r\nPlease forgive the hiatus as I have been extremely
    busy at work. I have every intention of continuing this discussion. I want to
    give some time and thought to anymore responses that I make as we have already
    covered a lot of ground. I will respond to 'being a teacher in a mental health
    setting', 'trauma and internal arts', 'mental illness and internal arts', 'assumptions
    about students', 'facts about mental illness not myths' and 'race and mental illness'.
    Have I missed anything?\r\nDorothy, I have registered at \"The Embodied Soul Center\"
    and will be checking out the talks over the weekend. I look forward to the interview
    with you, Dan and, as I said, I will be adding more to this post.\r\nDerek"

title: Tai Chi and Embodiment for Anxiety and Depression

<p>Last week I had the pleasure of recording a conversation with my friend and Tai Chi colleague Dorothy Fitzer.</p>
<p>Drawing on her background in movement, energy arts, and psychotherapy, Dorothy has put together a very interesting group of practitioners from several different modalities to address the question of <strong>how embodiment practices can lead to nourishing, healing, and even transformative experiences.</strong></p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/reYPtvRbeE0?rel=0" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, I was thrilled to make the case that this is at the core of so much of what we do in Tai Chi.</p>
<p>Dorothy and I discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tai Chi's techniques for <a title="How To Calm Your Mind Through Movement" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/09/10/how-to-calm-your-mind-through-movement/">synchronizing the movement of the mind and the body</a> - and the grounding effect this has on the mind.</li>
<li>How you learn to recognize "doing" as another layer of tension when you practice any form of <a title="Qigong and Meditative State" href="http://dankleiman.com/qigong-and-meditative-state/">Taoist Qigong</a>.</li>
<li>Different Tai Chi/qigong techniques for getting the mind to quiet down and experience stillness.</li>
<li>The Yin and Yang of Depression and Anxiety.</li>
<li>How <a title="Neutralizing Stressful Interactions with Tai Chi Push Hands" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/10/08/neutralizing-stressful-interactions-with-tai-chi-push-hands/">Tai Chi's interactive practices</a> teach you to resolve interpersonal conflicts without fear and bask in the spontaneity that comes from not going into fear-based reactions.</li>
<li>And a few more things...</li><br />
</ul><br />
You can listen in on our conversation on Tuesday, April 8, but Dorothy will be sharing all of the conversations, some live and some pre-recorded, over the next two weeks.</p>
