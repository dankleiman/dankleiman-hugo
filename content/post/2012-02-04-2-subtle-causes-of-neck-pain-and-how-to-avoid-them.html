  content: Great explanation, Dan.  I've thought of (and have...)  imbalanced movement
    of the eyes but not really related this to neck pain.  Are there chi gung exercises
    for the eyes and connecting this to lead movement of the head and neck? I've also
    explored the other sense organs (nose, ears and also the lips/ tongue) to initiate
    movement.  It is on our (as infants) developmental pattern as we learn to explore
    the world.  Best...

  content: Hey, Bob. All the visual work I've done has been from my Z Health training,
    in the context of neurological/spatial/postural control, not chi gung per se.
    I don't really have solid exposure to the other organs the way you're describing,
    but I know people who have done work like that and highly recommend it too. I
    tried to put some of the basics of the visual work I'm familiar with together
    in an introductory way on the Get Moving page. Let me know what you think!

  content: I viewed Train Your Eyes.  Interesting and I think that you are on to something.  I
    remember in some tai chi courses (various teachers...), a "common" question is
    "where do I look"  It's sort of like, where do I put my hand. Application informs
    us.  One point in my Body-Mind Centering training I recall is that shifting to
    peripheral vision neuro-muscularly relaxes the suboccipitals... Wow, so much to
    practice...   Other developmental/ integrative understanding shows that overuse
    of eyes is easily done and can be straining. The vestibular system, which you
    cite, is the sense which develops before the eyes and is directly connected to
    movement and proprioception and can help relax tension in the eyes. I'm sure you've
    gotten/ will get to this.

  content: OK, I did the head movements and with and without eye facilitation.  Great
    stuff that really helps release the neck. One thing I utilized in neck flexion
    is when turning the eyes downward to facilitate flexion, I minded the back of
    the eyeball to rotate "upwards"  to help lengthen the back of the neck and 'prevent'
    crunching the front of the neck. thanks!

  content: Great stuff, Bob. Yes, we tend to play a lot with the way the visual and
    vestibular systems contribute to proprioception. You sort of have to rule out
    whether they are causing trouble first, and then you can use them to your advantage,
    the way you're describing. Let me know how it goes!

<p>One of my students says that in medical school they were taught how to explain their clinical observations in a way that made them sound more official. For example, if you see something once, you can say that "in my experience..." The second time you've observed the same phenomenon, you can say that "in case after case...." Finally, if you're seeing something more than two times, you've seen it "in a series of cases."</p>
<p>Well, last week, in case after case of neck-related pain and discomfort, the cause of the pain came down to one simple movement principle: substitution.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-2949"></a>In this video, I explain how the nervous system bridges the gap between what you ask your body to do and performing that task by any means it can. Practically, this can result in the wrong body part moving for one that doesn't respond to the call of the nervous system, or "substitution."</p>
<p>Chronic substitution leads to pain, discomfort, and sets the stage for injury.</p>
<h2>Specific Causes of Neck Pain</h2><br />
In the case of neck pain, you'll often see under-performing eyes or stuck vertebrae force the neck into excess movement:<br />
