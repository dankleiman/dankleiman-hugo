  content: "Just a couple of questions :\r\n1) those \"gates\" for Yiquan, are there
    the same for Hsing Yi Santi ?\r\n2) the time limits (20 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours)
    : are they for standing on 2 feet with equal weight or for stnding on one foot
    (Santi)\r\n3) If it's standing on just one foot, are the \"gates\" markers for
    doing both sides (so 10 minuts on the left + 10 minutes on the right = the 20
    minutes Mark) or are they for each side (so the 2 hours mark would be for standing
    on only the left side, and the total practice time would be 2 hours) ?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nErwan"

  content: "Dara, I've never thought about testing in school that way, but it makes
    perfect sense.\r\n\r\nErwan, the time thresholds definitely vary posture by posture
    and the make the distinction between cultivation postures, like the one in the
    picture, versus martial postures, that tend to me more physically demanding. \r\n\r\nWhat
    I've noticed so far is that by going back through the same time day after day
    (before I get to the \"new\" minute), you pass through similar phases as different
    time markers. Like, at ten minutes, upper body alignments settle in, at 20, spine
    and legs connect in a particular way. I don't think this is textbook or universal
    or anything, but these patterns tend to repeat for several days in a row. One
    of the virtues of using a big external timer is that I can make these correlations
    to the times. Don't know how they did it in the old days! \r\n\r\nAfter a few
    days, though, I reach the old thresholds faster and then get surprised by new
    ones that show up. \r\nThere's also a whole other discussion to be had about the
    way that the connections built in standing carry over into moving practice."

  content: Hmmmm, do those landmarks (20 minutes, one hour, 2 hours) correspond to
    the time one stands on one foot, or to the total practice time (meaning one stands

  content: "Hi Erwan,\r\n\r\nI don't know. Even here, you can take \"holding on both
    sides\" as an interesting structural element of practice. In a posture like San
    Ti when you hold it on each side, what happens when one side feels different than
    the other? What if one side is weaker? This is a perfect opportunity to use the
    clock to help you find internal balance. Match the weaker side, explore where
    it collapses, and learn to expand from the inside out, again, without toughing
    it out. \r\n\r\nLet's us know what you find!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDan"

  content: "Awesome article, Dan! I've experienced a very similar process when doing
    breath extension practices within Taoist Longevity Breathing. Having that external
    barometer gives a great feedback loop. For sure, it's possible to begin to poison
    a practice by becoming overly fixated on an arbitrary goal instead of the process
    to get you there, but the observation of that in and of itself becomes a more
    dynamic way of living the 70% principle.\r\n\r\nWhen I was initially asking around
    about doing a timed breathing practice, several folks strongly urged against making
    a time goal (30seconds, a minute , or whatever) the primary focus of a practice.
    I definitely get where they're coming from, but found for myself that having that
    external feedback made me increasingly aware of what I was doing internally to
    lead my breath deeper. Basic relaxation of muscles and nerves were an excellent
    springboard and foundation in the beginning, but as breaths became progressively
    longer, the emotional backdrop of what was limiting the breath started to become
    more clear.\r\n\r\nFeeling that boundary imposed by a clock or timer started making
    me more aware of how I was emotionally reacting to a mild challenge to my capacity.
    That opened the door to directly addressing and  releasing the anxiety, fear,
    sorrow, greed, etc. that had actually become my unseen glass ceiling, and then
    also explore the relationship to how those emotions were directly inhabiting the
    physical tissues. Though I haven't done as much of this kind of practice with
    standing, I imagine that it would be similar when standing in santi and having
    the burning set in. It kind of becomes a game of which self imposed brake do I
    need to release, or redundant cargo do I need to throw overboard to allow myself
    the better gas mileage or wind in my sails to easily complete this particular
    leg of the journey. Mile markers are really useful for that.\r\n\r\nFor me, I
    suppose it's like lighting a fire with my practice. It takes a while to gather
    up the kindling, it takes some more time to get it started, then some bigger logs
    get tossed on and I'm toastily enjoying a few chi marshmallows...but if I hang
    out too long or put too many logs on, my eyes are bleary from the smoke and I'm
    getting burned by the heat, and there are repercussions the next day (too close
    to the fire, no brakes, and no cargo just leaves me a charred, wrecked, starving
    mess, but metaphor has  now gotten the better of this way too long post,haha!).\r\n\r\nOne
    last quick thing, I've actually really been enjoying standing lately also, and
    have many times been doing the practice with the Sounds of the Tao liturgies by
    Bruce going in the background. They actually do seem to enhance aspects of the
    practice, and since you get familiar with the track times pretty quickly, it acts
    as kind of a clock that also facilitates the practice. \r\n\r\nPeace,\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\nP.S.
    I believe that I've heard stories about Don practicing rooting by having someone
    release the parking brake on a truck parked uphill? Not once have I had to stop
    a renegade Ford on my natural Taoist strolls through the woods. ; ) Those push
    hands classes do sound great though!"

  content: "Hey Paul,\r\n\r\nThanks for weighing in. You nailed a lot of points I'd
    been trying to describe. I especially like the fire analogy. You're right, without
    the external feedback, you just kind of wander around in the woods aimlessly.
    That's not the same as letting go and learning to follow internal changes, but
    they tend to get conflated.\r\n\r\nHe offered to teach me the truck practice,
    by the way. ;-)\r\n\r\nD"

<p><img src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130326-094857.jpg" alt="20130326-094857.jpg" class="alignleft size-full" />I get the question all the time, or at least it's always implied, "When am I going to get it?" Or, "how do I know if I'm getting good at this?"</p>
<p>Now, let's unpack a little bit of what's behind this question and then I want to share some different ways that I think you can answer this question on your own, without even asking your teacher.</p>
<h2>Practice Goals</h2></p>
<p>I'm on a training trip this weekend out in New Mexico with <a href="http://dankleiman.com/robert-tangora-tai-chi/">Robert Tangora</a>. Robert is teaching to six of us, twice a day, for two hours each session and the only agenda is giving personal feedback. </p>
<p>Why did I travel across the country for this? Isn't there enough to work on in my regular weekly practice? What do I hope to get out of it (besides revisiting all my favorite restaurants in Santa Fe)?</p>
<p>The open-ended opportunity to get personal feedback was intriguing to me for two reasons: one was that I value Robert's input and have learned a ton whenever I've studied with him. I figured there would be lots more to take in if the week was tailored to my practice needs.</p>
<p>The second reason was the format. By having two shorter classes per day, we're going to have big chunks of practice time in the afternoon and evening. Being on the other side of the country, with fewer work responsibilities, I knew I could devote some solid practice time to integrating the small chunks of feedback I'd be getting in each session. </p>
<p>The goal of this training format is to set up a rapid feedback loop where new input is balanced with integrative practice, twice a day. </p>
<p>Normally, it's hard to feel the loop. You go to class once, maybe twice a week, and you can get swept up in whatever the teacher leads you through. In our busy lives, it's hard to find time to do additional practice, especially when carving out time to commit to class may have been a challenge in the first place. </p>
<p>A lot of you who read this site are in the reverse situation. You get occasional input from an instructor in person, or did years ago, but now you have to figure out how to upgrade your practice on your own. </p>
<p>In both cases, we're all often left wondering, "how do I know if I'm making progress?"</p>
<h2>Process vs. Outcomes</h2></p>
<p>Most people that I talk to come to Tai Chi and qigong for the way it makes them feel. Or I should say, keep coming back to it because of the way it feels. There's nothing competitive or achievement-oriented about having a daily renewal activity. </p>
<p>Compared to weight lifters, triathletes, or your friend who plays in a softball league, you might get left feeling like you've got nothing to show for your practice. The benchmarks and fruits of your practice are harder to discern because the endeavor is largely process-driven. </p>
<p>But I want to suggest that "process vs. outcome" is a distinction you don't need to make. Instead, do both: create outcomes to shoot for, then settle into the process and enjoy it.</p>
<p>I learn more when I set small, measurable goals in my practice and furthermore, I feel much more confident answering the question, "am I getting better?" when mini-goals are part of my training routine. </p>
<h2>Quantity or Quality</h2></p>
<p>So what should you measure? <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/12/17/tai-chi-moving-for-better-balance-with-dr-fuzhong-li/">Do you hook yourself up to a balance machine</a>? Measure the number of squats you can do in an hour (hint: fewer is better!)? </p>
<p>Applied to qigong and Tai Chi, quantifying starts to get ridiculous pretty quickly...and it's not the right way to go about it, if your only goal is to reach a certain number. </p>
<h2>Tracking Quality Over Time</h2></p>
<p>Recently, I wrote an article for <a href="https://dankleiman.wufoo.com/forms/q7p5x7/">Paul Cavel's Inner Quest Journal</a> explaining a tracking process I went through for a hundred days of spinal bowing. I would practice this one technique for 5 minutes a day and then record my experience in a spreadsheet. </p>
<p>My rule was that I wasn't going to spend a lot of time writing about what happened and I wasn't going to spend a lot of time reading what I had written. I could only look back every once in a while to look for patterns. I didn't want the reflection time to outweigh the actual practice time!</p>
<p>Just the act of recording revealed something surprising: the next day when I started out, I was more aware of what I had done the previous day (since I had verbalized it) and could return to certain themes, more than I would have otherwise. This one little act helped me build more momentum around one practice principle than I had experienced ever before in this timeframe. </p>
<h2>Setting an Outward Goal to Find an Inward State</h2></p>
<p>Since the hundred-day spinal practice yielded such interesting results, I was on the lookout for a new way to bring structure to my practice. At Brookline Tai Chi, Don Miller was just beginning a Yiquan standing class and I caught the standing bug again.</p>
<p>In the first class we talked about "gates" or practice thresholds that Yiquan Masters said held new insights and rewards when you passed through them. For standing postures, this was a time marker, 20 minutes, one hour, two hours. </p>
<p>I had been down that road before with standing qigong, and knocked on the one-hour gate, but never really traveled through it. This time, though, something inside me clicked, and I found deep motivation to start up again. I say this because just standing by the clock can be awful, and not productive at all. Normally, I think you should spend lots of time just standing naturally, and seeing how long it is when you feel like it's time to quit. That will teach you a lot.</p>
<p>For whatever reason at this point in time, though, building up to longer standing periods just seemed like the thing I needed to do. I've gone through periods like this in the past, naturally slowing down until a 5-minute form would take me 30 minutes, for example. I've never been back to that and I don't know how it happened in the first place, but at the time, that's what my system needed. </p>
<p>For the standing experiment, the rule I set for myself was to find my natural threshold, then add one minute each day. So far, about 20 days in, this has felt like a good pace. For the first couple of weeks, I finished feeling like I wanted to do more. That's a good sign that I'm not hitting internal resistance yet.</p>
<p>If all goes well, I should be able to report back about the two-hour gate in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>When I told Don what I was doing, he said, "well that doesn't sound very Taoist." But here's the thing. Over the years I've learned if you only rely on your internal compass, the way the Taoist sages seem to advise, you get fooled into quitting too soon, thinking it's the natural way. </p>
<p>More and more I believe that you need to set up artificial structures, like my time experiment, to reveal your true limits and fluctuations. If I let my arms down the first time I get tired, I will never realize that adjusting the foot or opening the hip would send a surge of energy that would boost the arms, and I could go on for five more easy minutes.</p>
<p>Is there a limit on the other side where  you unnaturally force it? Of course. But if you never run little experiments in your practice, you'll never know the difference. </p>
<p>Now, before you go off and set up an experiment for yourself, let me be clear, it's not just pushing through the number that's important. In fact, it's not really about pushing yourself at all. Instead, the structure of your practice creates a sort of backdrop for learning. When you return to the same scene each day, you pick up contrast and insight that you would miss otherwise. You set your natural internal fluctuations against the same practice conditions, so that you reveal new facets of the internal changes, not so that you beat the external number. </p>
<p>I'll try to give examples of different markers I discover along this current path as I go, and now that I've told you about it, I guess I better keep moving!<br /><br /></p>
