  content: "Thanks Don and Dan.\r\nYour focus on the fundamentals of balance is most
    valuable.\r\nNew: trial moves from different balance centers: head, then chest,
    then legs, then feet and compare the different feelings.\r\n\r\nBob \r\nPost Falls,

<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4731" alt="don U post on bridge" src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/don-U-post-on-bridge-e1374169158691.jpg" width="179" height="344" />In this episode of Qigong Radio, <a href="http://dankleiman.com/tag/don-ethan-miller/">Don Miller</a> and I explore the essential elements of Tai Chi Balance Training.</p>
<p>As you probably know, Tai Chi is being used more and more for falls prevention programs for the elderly and becoming a mainstream part of the Western medical vocabulary.</p>
<p>But what are the actual elements that make up a great Tai Chi balance training program?</p>
<p>How can you use them for your own well-being?</p>
<p>How do you share Tai Chi balance training with your friends and family?</p>
<p><strong>Here are our thoughts on:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ways to develop "Root" that make you more stable and relaxed</li>
<li>Finding "Central Equilibrium" for more integrated movement</li>
<li>The psychological dimensions of Tai Chi practice, and how you can sneak up on them by improving your body awareness</li>
<li>The deep satisfaction that comes from literally connecting to the Earth</li><br />
</ul><br />
We explore student experiences, roadblocks, and concerns as well as giving you practical tidbits to play with while you listen.</p>
