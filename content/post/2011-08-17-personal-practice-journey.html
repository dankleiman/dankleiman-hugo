<p>Having the luxury of a <a href="http://dankleiman.com/tag/wsfit2011">full month of training</a> this summer has made me step back and reflect on my own personal practice over the last 13 years. I tried to put together some of what this process has been like for me and sum it up <a href="http://dankleiman.com/about/">here</a>. I'm curious to know what you think. Have you gone through periods of practicing without a teacher? Have you had times where you've made huge strides in your practice? What was that like? Did the fruits of that period last a long time? Use the comments section below and let me know what it was like for you (or shoot me an email, but other people are probably curious too!).</p>
