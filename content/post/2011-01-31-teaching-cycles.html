<p>I'm coming to another big teaching cycle in Trainerfly and I think this short clip of David Heinemeier Hansson speaking at Stanford's Entrepreneurship Corner is really useful to frame the mindset:<a id="more"></a><a id="more-574"></a></p>
<p><object id="single" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="500" height="302" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="flashvars" value="config=http://ecorner.stanford.edu/embeded_config.xml%3Fmid%3D2361" /><param name="src" value="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/swf/player-ec.swf" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed id="single" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="302" src="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/swf/player-ec.swf" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="config=http://ecorner.stanford.edu/embeded_config.xml%3Fmid%3D2361"></embed></object></p>
<p>I know the point in the clip above is more about a strategy to take when you look at the "big guys", but I really feel like the alternating cycles of "spending" and "teaching" are relevant here. We just went through a "spending" period where we were building out the technology behind Trainerfly. That was only possible because we went through a "teaching" period initially, where I learned what problems I wanted to solve with a software application.</p>
<p>Now I'm entering another "teaching" cycle as I share the fruits of the "spending" cycle, a viable software solution, with other peers in movement education. It gets even more interesting if you chart the smaller cycles within each of the major cycles.....hmmmm, where have I encountered that kind of thinking before??</p>
