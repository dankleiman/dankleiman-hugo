  content: 'An additional plus from practicing tai chi on the beach: I find that the
    behavior of the gulls around me makes for an automatic biofeedback mechanism .
    . . they don''t budge so long as I''m doing my form, as they do when people walk
    in a straight line down the beach. They don''t even budge when I''ve finished
    the form, so long as I''m still in settling/integrating mode. The minute my thoughts
    become mundane, as in ''I better go make breakfast,'' they''re off.'

<p style="text-align: left;">Practicing Tai Chi or Chi Gung on the beach feels great, once you get past the funny looks and comments from passers-by! If you want to make the most out of your practice time on the beach, or in any other natural setting, you have to practice a little differently than you do during indoor practice.</p><br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-1697"></a><br />
Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Take Extra Time to Settle In: </strong>Start by doing a little more quiet sitting or standing, "listening" to what's going on inside you. Like turning the knob on a radio scanner, you're waiting until you come across the right frequency. Don't be surprised if this takes longer than normal if you're used to practicing in a quiet, private space. Not only are you surrounded by more activity, but everyone is there because it feels great to be near the ocean -- you're listening for the energy of the ocean too. <strong><br />
</strong></li></p>
<li><strong>Feel All Around You: </strong>What goes on inside you mirrors what goes on outside, this is a basic chi gung principle. Once you've tuned in sitting or standing and you start moving, spread your focus out, all around you. This isn't some weird energy trick, it's just going to feel different to practice on the beach. Notice that and feel how it shifts the quality of your movements.</li>
<li><strong>Take Extra Time to Integrate: </strong>To finish your practice, you always want to have an integration moment. When you've been "practicing with the ocean", it's even more important. Go back to your quiet sitting or standing and just like the waves smoothing out the stones on the beach, let your insides get as smooth as possible.</li><br />
</ol><br />
When you start to pay attention to what different practice settings feel like, or when you practice at different times during the day, you develop a much deeper feel for chi. You will notice patterns, cycles, and connections that you otherwise wouldn't. And what's the secret? Slowing down and listening to your insides. Enjoy!</p>
