<blockquote><p>Work hard, right at the edge of your abilities, fast enough to make mistakes, but slow enough to notice and correct them. Do it often. Do it with the deliberate intention of making every training session and every rep better. Do this by focusing not on outcomes such as winning or losing but rather on small chunks of skill that can be developed on an ongoing basis.<br />
</blockquote></p>
