<p>When you really find the groove with your Tai Chi practice, it's like listening to a piece of music.</p>
<p>The rhythms, riffs, and notes phase in and out, sometimes blending, and sometimes really standing out on their own, and even though there's a lot going on, you can soak it all in at once.</p>
<p>Can you practice Tai Chi the same way?</p>
<p>This isn't just an analogy, there's a major lesson buried in here. Can you spot it?<br />

<p><strong>Big Takeaway:</strong> Whenever you find yourself "thinking" your way through your Tai Chi practice, remember what it's like to listen to great music. Approach the internal principles of Tai Chi just like you would settle in for your favorite song. When you can truly listen to your practice the same way, you know you've begun integrating Tai Chi on a deep level.</p>
