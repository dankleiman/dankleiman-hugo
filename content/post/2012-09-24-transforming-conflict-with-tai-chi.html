  of Tai Chi practice, you cultivate your ability to listen -- to your own internal
  state, to the energy of other people, and to the world around you.\r\n\r\nWhen it
  comes to interaction, and intense interaction like conflict, your internal state
  matters.\r\n\r\nThe very first lesson you learn in Tai Chi Push Hands is that the
  outcome of an interaction is determined by your reaction, your internal state --
  whether you manifest tension or relaxation.\r\n\r\nIn this episode of Qigong Radio,
  we explore the different dimensions of this \"law of interaction.\"\r\n\r\nTaking
  responsibility for the outcome of a situation by owning how you respond is a challenging
  idea, but the payoff is huge and maybe even transformational.\r\n\r\n"
