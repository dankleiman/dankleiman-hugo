<p>I'm pretty excited about this: <a href="/courses/eyes-and-visual-training/" target="_blank">Eyes and Visual Training</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-714" title="Floating Hot Dog" src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Hot-Dog-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" />It's my new online course and the first in the Foundations of Relaxation Series I wrote about <a href="/2011/02/15/introducing-the-foundations-of-relaxation-series/">here</a>. As I've been developing the course, I keep saying to myself, "I wish everyone who comes to see me for pain relief or to learn tai chi did this first."

<p>I'm offering it at a pretty steep discount on what I plan to sell it for: $49 for now, instead of $97 (so snatch it up!). Plus, you get lifetime access to the material, so you can keep coming back to it and working on it.</p>
<p>There are a host of secondary reasons this is exciting too. One of them is that I'm using Trainerfly, my web-based training app, to run the course. I'm already using it with private clients and remotely teaching a tai chi group in Maine, but this is the first full course. I'm sure I'll learn a ton by doing it, which is great, because I have a few other tai chi teachers interested in doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Look for updates on how it's going once people are in the system working with the course material!</p>
