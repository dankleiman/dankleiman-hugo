<p>Allow me to share with you a Tai Chi principle so simple and clear that it is often overlooked, even by practitioners who have been doing Tai Chi for 10 years or more.</p>
<p>The Five Movement Centers is a template for understand HOW you move and applying it to any form you know or any repetitive movement you can perform, like going for a walk, is going to have a serious impact on how grounded, fluid, and connected you feel.</p>
<p>In this clip from the <a title="The Tai Chi Way to Better Balance" href="http://dankleiman.com/better-balance/">Tai Chi Way to Better Balance</a>, Don Miller demonstrates each of the Movement Centers.</p>
<p>Watch how his shifting changes as he goes through all five. Do you recognize these patterns?</p>

<p>Try it out and let me know how it feels!</p>
