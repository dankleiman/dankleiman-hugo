<p>Check out <a href="http://www.trainerfly.com/2011/04/11/how-i-launched-my-first-online-course/" target="_blank">this post from the Trainerfly blog</a>. I talk to teachers and trainers all the time who want move beyond their live events, but the number of steps it takes, and the technology required to make it work seem overwhelming. Hopefully, I've made a little dent in that perception!</p>
