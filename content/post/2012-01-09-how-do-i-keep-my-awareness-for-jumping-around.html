  content: I really like your analogy of the sponge.  Although my sinking practice
    is not completely dialed yet I feel like its getting there; much thanks to your
    take on it and guided session.  Be the sponge! :)

excerpt: "One of the major goals of standing qigong is to develop a strong downward
  flow that clears stagnant energy out of your system and strengthens your natural
  restorative abilities.\r\n\r\nWhen you begin to work on this process, though,&Acirc;
  it's natural to wonder how strict you need to be able sticking with the downward
  flow and what to do if you start to notice other things happening in the body. Recently,
  I got this question via email that nails the exact issue:\r\n\r\n<em>If I get distracted
  for a second or my attention bounces unconsciously to another part of the body,
  or I notice that my alignments begin to collapse -- basically when I lose the continuity
  of the scan -- should I start over from the top of the head or continue from where
  I left off?</em>\r\n"

<p>One of the major goals of standing qigong is to develop a strong downward flow that clears stagnant energy out of your system and strengthens your natural restorative abilities.</p>
<p>When you begin to work on this process, though,&Acirc;  it's natural to wonder how strict you need to be able sticking with the downward flow and what to do if you start to notice other things happening in the body. Recently, I got this question via email that nails the exact issue:</p>
<p><em>If I get distracted for a second or my attention bounces unconsciously to another part of the body, or I notice that my alignments begin to collapse -- basically when I lose the continuity of the scan -- should I start over from the top of the head or continue from where I left off?</em><br />

<p>Here's my advice and a little more about how to think about the problem:</p>

<h2>Download a Guided Practice</h2><br />
You can download a 20-minute guided practice session that leads you through stabilizing this flow, first in the arms, then in the body <a href="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Sinking-without-Jumping.m4a">here</a>.</p>
