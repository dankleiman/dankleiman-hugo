  content: Bob, can you say any more about what that was like? How the yin/yang balance
    unfolded as you practiced? Asking because I still haven't refined my vocabulary
    for the experience!

  content: "Just a quick initial intro:\r\n\r\nSana Shanti, Nelson, B.C., is one of
    my favorite teachers.\r\nShe is a master of push hands.\r\nBut her primary focus
    is Standing Meditation.\r\n(Chen is her style of taiji--but I've never seen her
    do any Chen form).\r\nA typical intensive workshop is 5 hours on Sat. and 5 hours
    on Sun.\r\nThe furthest we got into a form was \"Commencement\"/Opening the form
    and holding the ball.\r\nAnd a lot of hands on touching in to feel softening and
    relaxation,\r\nwith a few smooth moves by her just to keep us honest.\r\n\r\nI
    am hardly a good spokesman for her, although I have practiced with her for 5,
    6,? years.\r\nShe has written a workbook, \"Taiji Wisdom, Standing Meditation,
    a Self-Cultivation Training Manual to Integrate Taiji Principles into your Body
    and Life.\"\r\n\r\nThe book covers:\r\nZhan Zhuang and alignment,\r\nCenteredness--Finding
    Home,\r\nSong,\r\nNonDoing\r\n\r\nEach joint in the Body\r\n\r\nIdentifying defaults\r\nLearning
    to Let Go\r\n\r\nHer key term is \"Allow.\"\r\nMaintain rootedness,\r\nlook for
    the transition between substantial and insubstantial.\r\nALLOW the insubstantial
    to join the rootedness,\r\ncarry the rooting through the transition\r\nJust like
    you were showing by slowly feeling the transition of weightedness in one leg while
    feeling the lightening in the other leg going empty.\r\nThis is basic to the art
    of taiji.\r\n\r\nAnother of her key phrases is look for \"hollows and projections\"\r\nShe
    exaggerates your flaws to enable you to become fully aware of them and to find
    ways to resolve them (She uses a tightened fist to illustrate.  I use Saran Wrap
    to illustrate to my students--when released the plastic wrap effortlessly expands,
    Voila!  PENG))\r\n\r\nYou are led to look for NOTHING.\r\n\r\nOne of her favorite
    teachers is Sam Masich. soften, lead, store and release.\r\nMadame Gao was also
    one of her teachers.\r\n\r\nGotta run now, but I may be able to put out something
    a little more coherent later.\r\n\r\nBob"

  content: "Hey,\r\njust a few more words and terms re: Dan's question,\r\n\"How the
    yin/yang balance unfolded as you practiced?\"\r\n\r\n(my note: these comments
    are from notes I took during her class 2 years ago. \r\nFirst, note-taking actually
    can inhibit the understanding of a subtle feeling.  \r\nSecond, therefore, one
    needs to get the feeling understood first.\r\nAnd third, I kept interrupting her
    to fill in my notes.  She politely told me to shut up--I was interrupting the
    flow of what she was trying to develop.  Then I got angry with her --even though
    it was really my own fault.  For 2 years my stubborn attitude chilled any possibility
    of really understanding the subject feeling.\r\nThis year, I took no notes and
    promised her that I'd keep my big mouth shut--only then did I begin to understand
    the feeling she was trying to describe--it is a very delicate teaching/learning
    \ process.\r\nSo, this was the first yin/yang balance that had to take place during
    the unfolding of the lesson--2 years--Yike!)\r\n\r\nsana likes to use the term
    \"VORTEX.\"\r\nEverything has a vortex.\r\nWe have to become aware of our \"vortexing.\"\r\nThe
    classics state that there must always be UP in DOWN.\r\nHowever, we can allow
    ourselves to be sucked into the vortex of one or the other.\r\nFor example, when
    weighting that right leg to become more and more substantial:\r\nwe can actually
    overdo it, getting sucked into the vortex of downedness.\r\nThe seed of UP must
    remain in the DOWN.\r\nYou might have to borrow a little of the UP energy of the
    unweighted/insubstantial leg and balance a  dangerous DOWN movement of energy.
    \ This needs to be done/balanced in each joint, e.g. the right hip--take a little
    of the UP energy from the left hip and balance excess DOWN energy in the right
    hip.\r\nsana might say that there is a natural tendency to feel the downward pull/sensation
    of gravity and the already felt sensation/strength in the lower body.  So it's
    easy to get sucked into a DOWNward vortex.\r\nThen we might have to focus a bit
    more on maintaining the UP during this DOWNward weighting operation.\r\n\r\nMirrors
    in the taiji studio present the same problem.  Our visual attention can get sucked
    away from our energy gates as we look out towards the mirror to check our alignment.
    \ This is why we're instructed to merely gaze to the horizon, not focusing on
    anything in particular.  We can get sucked into the VORTEX/Hubris/ pride of our
    beautiful form--Ahh, I'm so beautiful, nice work Bob--sure.\r\nLikewise, always
    craning your neck out of alignment to see/copy the instructor is another way to
    fall into a destructive VORTEX.\r\n\r\nFurthemore, in FORWARD there must be BACK.\r\nWe
    are so front-oriented.\r\nIn fact, naturally when we breath in, our bodies naturally
    lean imperceptively forward--close your eyes and you can feel additional pressure
    on your toes as you breath in.  Also look up with your eyes and you can feel the
    same tendency to lean forward.  Therefore, in order to keep balanced you may have
    to introduce bias for the backward element--like that electronic equalizer that
    Gary referred to--the \"BACK knob\" has to be cranked up a skosh.\r\n\r\nThis
    is why sana instructs us to look for any \"projections\" in the joint (hip)--\r\nmade
    even harder if your have acquired a default position of carry-the-baby-on-the-hip
    projection of the hip--or we raise our eyes when we're going cerebral to understand,
    mentally a point--GONG!, you've just lost the point.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of the
    art of taiji is that it trains us to\r\n\"Allow the mind/body state to transcend
    the mind,\" sana's quote.\r\n\r\nAnd paradoxically, it is the energy awareness
    that you want  to let go of.\r\nNONDOING."

  content: "Bob, great stuff! Your struggle with note-taking is such a good lesson
    and a trap we all get caught in when trying to process or express the feel of
    practice.\r\nI love the teaching points to: so many permutations of finding yin
    in yang and vice versa. Right on with the technical details of the joints too.\r\nThanks
    for sharing this!"

title: Empty Leg Practice for Balance, Stability, and Flow

<p>Try this follow-along practice on Emptying the Leg. </p>
<p>We're combining principles from Standing Qigong and Tai Chi to create a blend of stillness, movement, and internal contrast.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/FpJdSA46MtA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The progression includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Varying your stance, increasing in complexity and physical demands.</li>
<li>Increased contrast over time between empty and full or unweighted and weighted legs</li>
<li>Heightened sense of sinking as you stabilize in each posture</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p><strong>Perhaps the most surprising element of this exercise is the way that it's going to help you build flow. Once you've set up the yin/yang contrast in the legs, you begin to search it out in your moving forms. Instead of thinking of shifting the weight, you dial in greater contrast between the legs, and that leads you to movement.</strong></p>
