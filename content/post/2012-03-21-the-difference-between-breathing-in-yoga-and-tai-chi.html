  content: "Hello there- I happened to be pulled back to the site today-now, and when
    I saw this I had a thought I felt compelled to write (you, Dan, seemed to reference
    it near the end ~3:50 or so).  About how using the breath with a flow- each revs
    the other, and as breathing is more linked into nerves as well as the mind that
    is driving- it can \"rev up\" emotions as well as psych-ologic structures.   (as
    i wrote this it might seem that lengthening or Yin-Yang merids/wrapping or spiralling/jumping
    also involve the nerves, but it doesn't seem to have this destabilizing affect
    to \"pierce the subcon-con barrier\".. ) anyway, it really sunk into me how Bruce
    emphasized that doing a practice like using a \"flow\" (ie pulsing) to drive breathing
    and breathing to drive \"flow\" (pulsing)... thus a fdbk cycle... can bring up
    \"stuff\"- tapping things out of awareness.. if one's practice allows you to recognize
    that \"contact\" (surge/shift in breathing or movement or mind's cliarity) that
    is good, as you can dive the depths... but if one is caught up in it.. that can
    'wirein' some strange links (not to good)... thus seated meditation (or even lying
    down)... not moving, still-mind.. thus only doing the \"flow\" and breathing...
    so can catch changes.. even in Standing practice that may be missed, but more
    of a focus (thus a posture or Santi).. Bagua can be a good vehicle (at a plateau
    in one's practice (between the shifts where one is \"learning the walk/change\"
    better- thus it isn't \"auto)... if in a non-auto mode, and/or if the practice
    itself involves shifting awareness into different \"modes\" for different stages
    of the set (ie Marriage of H&amp;E, or Tai Chi Form)... in theory at high enough
    lvl but then...  (as you mention, I recall often speaking to people about Bagua
    and mentioning ways of doing the set, like for ex not twisting the spine, or \"how
    choose when to make the change- its motivation\" and reply has been 'such-and-such
    teacher does it... well but the way they describe their practice (Dragon soaring
    in the clouds, allowing the Energy of the Event itself to change you as it arises...
    \  umm)  \r\n\r\nanyway- thus I link in when in stationary practice, but not in
    movement, and even when I do in stationary.. for whatever I practice after that
    (ie if a different set in a practice session) and for later in the day, I am sure
    to keep reminding myself to check in... how am I feeling  (how often see a yoga
    person who practices early in the morning and not through the day but you see
    them afternoonish and see the bug eyes or just the slightly jitttery jerkiness...
    (maybe obviously, maybe just in their 'ching' energy vib, maybe a sense in their
    chi flows.. but not smooth-even-connected).\r\n\r\nIt helped me to write this
    out for myself- I need to review this at times, as I did that myself years ago-
    cheers\r\n\r\ngb"

    Hey Gary,
    I think the practice of activating something through rhythm and flow, then sitting back to see what it does on its own is pure gold.

  content: "Yeah- taking that in context what you spoke with Paul C in Radio#2 (great
    material hidden in there) about \"purpose\"- the trick being what is possible
    and potential isn't even guessed at, and many of the assumptions of any level
    (not just beginner, but when-ever as realization reveals later)- clearly \"no
    pain no gain\" or something like that, and then \"get\" oh- not necessarily.  So
    in regards to your comment the key is being able to see what it does (especially
    as that \"part that is doing the seeing\" can be affected- how not to be caught
    up in that).\r\n\r\nSecondly reminds me to the Bruce concept that incrreasing
    \"chi-flow\" in the psych-mental-emotional structure amplifies everything....
    (just like in the body, but that's usually all boats lifted with the tide, while
    amping in the mind increases thinking- clarity, also complexes- activates dormant..
    and approaches one's \"Threshold\"- in the sense that at a small intensity, nearly
    on is ok- if AMP it way up, what was only a bit off becomes clearly out of balance...
    \   \r\n\r\n       if in addition the AMP enervates irritation and snappiness
    or such- then what feels off, one doesn't just shrug off, but is driven nuts by...
    Etc..    and all this can be \"In Awareness\" but out of 'conscious'-awareness
    (like feeling something you are touching with a third hand).\r\n\r\nps gold is
    interesting reference- electrically conductive, meditation traditions (the golden
    radiance- the activated rainbow body), as well as Alchemy= good as gold, the gold-standard
    (the acid test re: Nitric acid)\r\n\r\nthe only trickiness is what I've been seeing
    groups talk about \"kundalini\" mess-up or chi-sickness (let alone zoa-ho-lo-mo,
    however that is spelled)- and implying always if something seems weird it won't
    be too much, and just let it sit and it will settle... while if working in the
    structural level- it is like taking-eating-drinking a substance.. maybe water,
    maybe sugary-caffine, maybe alcohol, but could be poison (perhaps not fatal but
    a neuro-toxin that has \"re-wired\" the nervous system)... or better analogy:
    change thing in a Software Application file- no big, change the software app code,
    could mess that up, but not affect computer? (or perhaps) change the config- OS
    level etc.    maybe on restarting the machine it wont?  or maybe it will and only
    once in a blue-moon something strange occur (like sudden \"tremor\" or hallucinations
    and chills)- which may persist until the system if re-coded...      same in the
    energetic levels of a person, if one is \"really\" working with chi (if just the
    affects of chi, and not chi itself- then let it settle and all should be fine)...\r\n\r\n
    \  just a thought- cheers- best wishes- I look fwd to posts you may make about
    this TuiShou course (especially as how it may be the \"same\" as doing solo, as
    you mentioned- the \"borrowing-absorbing and riding their chi  in their movement-attack
    into your, start after arrive first.. was one of the best I recall him teaching
    before)-  have a good day"

<p>As Nate and I were discussing specific breathing challenges in qigong and Tai Chi, he started to explain the way he had learned to work with breathing and movement in his yoga training.</p>
<p>It's fascinating to compare strategies for working with the mind-body connection across different systems, and while this is by no means a definitive exploration of similarities and differences, I think you'll see that there are two distinct approaches.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-3647"></a></p>

<p>Does this difference make sense to you? How does it compare to other breathing/meditation/mindfulness practices you've explored? Leave a comment and let us know!</p>
