<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4765" style="img: margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 2px solid #993300;" alt="T.T. Liang" src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Liang.jpg" width="167" height="250" />Tai Chi masters are known for maintaining vitality, balance and mobility well into old age. Don's first Tai Chi teacher, T.T. Liang, lived to be 102, and in his mid-eighties was still throwing young, large guys around in the Tai Chi game--somewhat akin to upright grappling or sumo--called "push hands" (tuishou).</p>
<p>His consummate skill with Chinese weapons&mdash;sword, cutlass, staff, spear&mdash;was still evident well into his 90's.</p>
<p>Don says:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the ten years I studied with him, I cannot say I ever saw Master Liang lose his balance. What is more, I learned much later that he was practicing Tai Chi on severely compromised feet, permanently damaged by the horrendous torture he endured at the hands of the Japanese during WWII.</blockquote></p>
<p>Many other Tai Chi masters are notable for their sustained "youthfulness" of the legs and hips, supple and strong in the decades when many are becoming stiff and weak.</p>
<p>Some of these effects are probably the result of simply continuing to exercise and move around, in fairly complex ways, and never "retiring" from movement. But they are also, I believe, in large part the embodiment of 3 major Tai Chi Principles, that are central to the art and developed fully over many decades of practice.</p>
<p>One of these 3 major principles is Central Equilibrium.</p>
