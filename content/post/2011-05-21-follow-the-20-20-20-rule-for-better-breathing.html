  content: "Hi Dan,\r\nThis was good information and it seems possible to do (with
    the 20-20-20 approach).  It sounds like standing is the requirement for this.
    \ Do you mean standing unsupported.....and do you monitor your breathing in any
    way?\r\nThanks,\r\nTracy"

  content: "I like standing vs. sitting or lying down for this practice in particular
    because when you do hit the 20 min mark, the action of the diaphragm is much stronger
    (all because of your orientation to gravity) than it would be in that \"autonomous
    mode\" in the other positions. The trade-off is that it's more difficult to do
    standing. \n\nWhen you're trying to find that threshold, you should be much more
    in an observing mindset with the breath, than trying to create a certain pattern.
    The other isolation exercises will work on the patterns, this one should feel
    fairly passive. \n\nLet me know if that makes sense!\n\nThanks,\nDan"

excerpt: Implementing a breathing practice that has an impact on your energy levels
  and actually chips away at stress can be tricky. It requires a blend of persistence
  and relaxation that can seem like a paradox at first. That's why I recommend the
  20-20-20 Rule (which I made up) for better breathing.

<p>Implementing a breathing practice that has an impact on your energy levels and actually chips away at stress can be tricky. It requires a blend of persistence and relaxation that can seem like a paradox at first. That's why I recommend the 20-20-20 Rule (which I made up) for better breathing.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-1442"></a></p>
<p>I explain the 20-20-20 Rule in this clip, pulled from the breathing course in my <a href="http://dankleiman.com/get-moving/">Foundations of Relaxation series</a>:</p>
