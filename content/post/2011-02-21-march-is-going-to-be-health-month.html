<p>I'm pretty excited to try this one out. Health Month is a behavior change game where you set rules to follow each month and do daily tracking, with rewards and penalties for how well you follow them. I'm just digging into it, but so far it looks like you can choose "do more of this" or "do less of that".<a id="more"></a><a id="more-638"></a> I like the idea of limiting the scope of the goal to a month (what BJ Fogg calls a "span" behavior instead of a "path" behavior -- and says the key to long term change is focusing on span not path) and the immediate feedback from daily tracking.</p>
<p>I'm curious about the reward system, to see if it really is compelling and there also is some kind of social wrinkle where you can help and get help from other players.</p>
<p>From the site, here's how to play:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>How to play</h1></p>
<h4 id="definition_summary">Are you new to Health Month?  Here's the quick and dirty.</h4><br />
Health Month is all about making small improvements to your health,  one month at a time.  Players (that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s you!) can choose 1 or more rules  to try to stick to for a month from the many different dietary, fitness,  relationship, mental health, and financial health behaviors that are  currently in the game.  For first time players, 1-5 rules is a nice way  to start.  Choose rules that you want to work on, and try to make small  improvements to your current behavior rather than going cold-turkey,  whole-hog, or crazy-wombat.  You can always ratchet up the difficulty  next month,  once you get the hang of it.</p>
<p><strong>What are life points?</strong></p>
<p>After you commit to your rules, you start each month with 10 shiny  new life points.  The goal is to end the month with at least 1 life  point.  You lose a life point whenever you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t stick to one of your  rules, but don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t worry if you lose all of your life points &acirc;&euro;" that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s what  friends are for!  Friends and other players of Health Month have your  back when you need to be healed (this is a big part of why Health Month  totally rocks compared to other health plans and services).  This game  is NOT about making you feel guilty.  It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s  about helping you discover what works for your current lifestyle (do  more of that) and what doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t (skip it).  Also, if you accidentally  over-commit yourself and and lose all of your life points (I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve seen  some people go to -100 life points and more!  Maybe there should be an  award for being ambitious?), it just means you can take it a little  easier next month.  Life is long.  Small improvements will make a bigger  impact long term.  And, by the way, you can still play the game if you  are -100 life points&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; everything still works as usual.</p>
<p><strong>When do I play?</strong></p>
<p>Every day, during the month that you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve committed to play, you can  come to the site and play your turn.  Spin the Wild Wheel if you feel  like adding an extra helping of whimsey to your game (don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t worry, most  of the outcomes are positive) or you can skip it and go straight to  filling out your daily scorecard without collecting $200.</p>
<p><strong>What do I do with fruit?</strong></p>
<p>If you follow all of your rules for a day, you get a piece of fruit.   You can use fruit to heal other players who have lost life points.   It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a good thing to do, because they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll remember you when you need to  be healed in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Where are my friends?</strong></p>
<p>Follow friends and team mates on Health Month to see a stream of how  everyone else is doing with their game (think Twitter or Facebook for  improving your life).  You&acirc;&euro;&trade;re all in it together, and posting questions,  tips, fears, and challenges that you run into helps remind you that  things like this work better when they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re done with friends and family.   Don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be afraid to invite them!  :)</blockquote></p>
