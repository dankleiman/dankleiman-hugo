<p>In <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2010/11/18/learn-qigong-online/">a recent post</a>, I asked the question "Can you learn qigong (or any movement art) online?" The answer was a big fat qualified "yes." I think there is a limited role that online resources can play in your movement education --- even though movement is something best learned through live human interaction.</p>
<p><strong>So the question for you, as a movement coach, is not whether or not you can teach online, the question is "what is the appropriate way to use online resources in my movement education business?"</strong></p>
<p>I believe that the primary use is not to replace your live teaching, but to reinforce it. Whatever you teach in the classroom, your students will need to see 10 more times before it sinks in. With such limited live time with your students, why not get the next best approximation in front of them as soon as you can. Throw up a video, or a written explanation, and let them reflect on the in-class experience.</p>
<p>There's a secondary benefit here of course, for your business.&Acirc;  Most likely, spending 2 or 3 or 4 hours a week with a student in person is on the high side. Do you see a student for an hour a week? How many hours a week do they need to be exposed to material to "get it"? If you can create a copy of your live training session online, to one degree or another, then their exposure to the material goes up, but your training time with them stays the same. <strong>You're multiplying your time. You're multiplying value for your client.</strong></p>
<p>This is the kind of topic I'm explore much more on the <a href="http://www.trainerfly.com" target="_blank">Trainerfly</a> blog. Trainerfly is a tool designed to solve exactly this kind of problem and help you, as a movement coach, grow a business that expands you teaching reach and makes the most of your limited live training time.</p>
