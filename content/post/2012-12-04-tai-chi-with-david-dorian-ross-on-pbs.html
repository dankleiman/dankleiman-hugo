  content: Hello, Since I live in the Netherlands (Europe) I have not been able to
    see this. I tried every way I could think of including trying to contact PBS.
    All with no result. Is there anyone able to tell me how to get this, I am very
    much interested, because of Dan's enthusiastic recommendation. Thanks

<p>This winter, PBS is airing a special one-hour introduction to Tai Chi with <a href="http://dankleiman.com/tai-chi-instructor-david-dorian-ross/" title="Tai Chi Instructor David Dorian Ross">David-Dorian Ross</a>.  I highly recommend watching the episode, whether you have a lot or a little Tai Chi experience.</p>
<p>The way Ross presents basic concepts and teaches body alignment and choreography is simple and clear. Above all, he moves between classical explanations rooted in Chinese Medicine and Western, physiological-based explanations in an elegant and understandable manner.</p>
<p>Here is the trailer from PBS:</p>

<h2>What New Practitioners Can Learn from "T'ai Chi for Health and Happiness"</h2><br />
If you have never done Tai Chi, or are new to the practice, David-Dorian Ross's approach will help you build a solid Tai Chi foundation.</p>
<p>He frames the practice around 3 main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Freedom</strong> -- the freedom from limitations we all tend to impose on ourselves. Many Tai Chi players will tell you they feel more confident and willing to experience new things, which I believe comes from the self-exploration inherent in learning Tai Chi.</li>
<li><strong>Flow</strong> -- the phrase, <a title="Bill Ryan on Developing Energy Sensitivity" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/04/30/bill-ryan-on-developing-energy-sensitivity/">"the mind moves the chi and the chi moves the blood"</a> is a central teaching in Tai Chi and he explains what this actually means, through easy-to-feel exercises.</li>
<li><strong>Power</strong> -- an interesting choice of words here because the height of "power" in Tai Chi is classically described as "non-doing" or "non-effort". He does a nice job moving people out of the Western mindset that tension or strength equals power. From a Tai Chi perspective, <a title="Learning to Soften the Body" href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/09/26/learning-to-soften-the-body/">strength only blocks flow</a>.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<h2>For Experienced Practitioners (Especially Instructors)</h2><br />
Now, if you watch this program and you have more experience in Tai Chi, you'll pick up a whole other layer of information.</p>
<p>I especially enjoyed the way he translated concepts from the Classics in an accessible way:</p>
<ul>
<li>To make flow more tangible, he had people <a title="The Internal Structure of Cloud Hands by Robert Tangora" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/06/18/the-internal-structure-of-cloud-hands-by-robert-tangora/">"Wave Hands Like Clouds"</a> sitting down before they attempted to move arms and legs together.</li>
<li>He described <a title="Sinking Your Mind through Your Body" href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/10/03/sinking-your-mind-through-your-body/">Song</a> as the internal state your cat or your child takes on when they don't want to be picked up and showed people how to have "heavy feet".</li>
<li>He introduced <a title="Refining Your Opening and Closing" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/08/13/refining-your-opening-and-closing/">opening and closing</a> in one of the first lessons on choreography.</li>
<li>The very first principle he taught was <a title="Spinal Qigong Exercises" href="http://dankleiman.com/spinal-qigong-exercises/">spinal alignment</a> in the broadest sense of spinal lengthening, but refined it several times as he was layering in more information.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Within the Tai Chi community, there is tendency to make the practice very obscure. People hide behind lofty concepts instead of giving clear explanations.</p>
<p>Of course, what you feel when you practice may be hard to explain, but I'm all in favor of seeing as much teaching as possible done in plain and direct language.</p>
<p>For that reason, I think this program is an excellent one for people to see as part of their introduction to Tai Chi.</p>
