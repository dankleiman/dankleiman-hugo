<p>I just started working with Bruce's new meditation program. I'm very excited to hear him framing this home-study series in terms of rhythms, pacing, and long term development. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-627"></a>Every couple of weeks he's putting out new guided practice recordings, which I think will be easy to follow-through on and fresh enough to keep people tuned into their practice. I'll let you know how it goes!</p>
