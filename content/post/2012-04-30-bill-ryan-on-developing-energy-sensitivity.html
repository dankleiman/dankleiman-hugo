  qigong or Tai Chi, people are often either more tuned into to energy or to their
  physical bodies. In this episode of Qigong Radio, I asked my first qigong and Tai
  Chi teacher, Energy Arts Senior Instructor and founder of Brookline Tai Chi, Bill
  Ryan to explain why this is.

<p>More importantly, Bill teaches you how to navigate the experiences of developing your internal energy, regardless of how you first become aware of them. It turns out, you're probably already more tuned in than you think.</p>
<p>If you are very sensitive to energy, Bill also has some great advice about how to become more grounded and balanced.</p>
