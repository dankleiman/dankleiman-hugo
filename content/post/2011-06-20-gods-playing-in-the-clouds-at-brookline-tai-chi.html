<p>We're running a little experiment at Brookline Tai Chi to see if providing students with practice reminders, <em>ahead of time</em>, will make them more comfortable starting the Gods Playing in the Clouds chi gung class this summer. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-1589"></a></p>

<p>The set is made up of six, repetitive spherical movements and I think, if students have a chance to practice the basic shapes before the class starts, they will be much more comfortable and ready to learn the nuances of the internal work that goes into these basic shapes.</p>
<p>I've created a basic instructional series to help students get ready and I hope they will use it as a reference point once the course begins to clear up any choreography confusion.</p>
<p>We'll see!</p>
