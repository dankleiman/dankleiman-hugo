<p>This year, why not persuade your friends and family to be a little healthier and move better?</p>
<p>I know that's always a tricky area to wade into, so&Acirc;  I've picked out a few things below that will help anyone become better educated about movement and inspire them to act (or trick them into it, depending on how you look at it!).</p>

<h2>The Perfect Shoe</h2><br />
If you ask me how many pairs of Vivo Barefoot shoes I own, I would ask you if you mean for just wearing around or for tai chi or for formal occasions.&Acirc;  I'm only kind of kidding...</p>
<p>They send out pretty good deals on these shoes on a regular basis, but this is the first time I've seen them throw in cool movement-related bonuses. There are two different deals right now, depending on which style of shoe you buy:</p>
<p><strong>Performance Package</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2639" title="performance package" src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/performance-package.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="300" />Includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A choice of VIVOBAREFOOT "performance" shoe</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born to Run</span> hard cover by Christopher McDougall ( a book that will make you reconsider whether you want to wear shoes ever again!)</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proprioception: Making Sense of Barefoot Running</span> book by Lee Saxby (same guy who put <a title="Running Rhythm" href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/04/07/running-rhythm/">these videos together</a>)</li>
<li>Learn the Skill DVD</li>
<li>Free Shipping</li><br />
</ul><br />
They say that this package is valued at up to $200, but prices start at $102 with this offer, using the 40% holiday code <strong>VBPP</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Add a pair of Evo, Evo II, Neo, or Neo Trail to your shopping bag</li>
<li>&Acirc; Add the item "Performance Holiday Package" to your shopping bag</li>
<li>&Acirc; When both items are entered in your cart, enter promo code: <strong>VBPP</strong> in the shopping bag to receive 40% off your complete holiday package.</li><br />

<h2>For the Keyboard Athlete in your life:</h2><br />
<a href="http://edge.affiliateshop.com/public/AIDLink?AID=99991&amp;BID=14857" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.zhealth.net/banners/KA-Affiliate-Banner-250x250.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Z Health Master Trainer Jen Waak has put together a really interesting "training manual" for the office athlete. Remember when Jen talked about <a title="Kilimanjaro Made Easy" href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/09/15/kilimanjaro-made-easy/">what she learned climbing Mount Kilimanjaro</a>? Well, her big trek was an escape from the cubicle.</p>
<p>Now, she's pulled that wisdom together in a guide to staying healthy when you're at your desk all day.</p>
<p>What I really like about her guide is the actual guide. She formatted it so it can stand upright on your desk for easy reference, like the picture on the left. Pretty clever!</p>

<h2>Winter Energy Boost</h2><br />
You know what it feels like to head into the darkest time of the year. It's fine to slow down and get quieter, but sometimes the winter blues can be a real energy drain. Why not perk up a little with a refreshing, invigorating qigong practice?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.energyarts.com/store/products/featured/dragon-and-tiger-book-dvd-poster-package#a_aid=dkleiman&amp;amp;a_bid=932cfb54" target="_blank">Dragon <img class="size-full wp-image-2660 alignleft" title="Dragon and Tiger Medical Qigong" src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dragon-and-tiger-dvd.jpg" alt="Dragon and Tiger Medical Qigong" width="250" height="250" />and Tiger Qigong</a> is a simple set to learn and the whole point of the exercises is to clear away stagnant chi and rev up your circulation. Anyone can learn it and have fun with it at the same time.</p>
<p>While you make take your practice seriously (if you read this blog regularly, I really hope you don't take it <em>too</em> seriously!), the person in your life who wants a casual introduction to qigong and something easy to practice with will really enjoy this DVD/book set.</p>
<p><img style="border: 0pt none;" src="http://www.energyarts.com/affiliate/scripts/imp.php?a_aid=dkleiman&amp;a_bid=932cfb54" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></p>
<p>The cool part about the way the set is packaged is that you'll get DVDs, a manual, and a wall chart. Energy Arts put a complete set of resources together for your home practice, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instruction on qigong warm-ups</li>
<li>Move-by-move how-to on DVD</li>
<li>Multi-level practice sets to follow on DVD</li>
<li>An illustrated manual with movement details</li>
<li>A wall chart you can use while you practice with key positions for each movement</li><br />
</ul><br />
I've been experimenting with what kind of resources work best for "home study" and I have to say that this combination will get you pretty close.</p>
<p>For someone who has never done qigong before, this is a safe, high-quality, and valuable introduction to the practice.</p>
