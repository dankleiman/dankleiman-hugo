<p>Are you a busy person who wants to learn techniques to become calmer and to reduce your levels of stress? Are you interested in gaining strength, improving your balance and generally becoming more flexible? If so, you will want to begin learning and practicing the ancient art of Tai Chi.</p>
<p>It's important that you find a good teacher with an excellent reputation to help you learn Tai Chi, like from a Bruce Frantzis Tai Chi <a title="Recommended Products" href="http://dankleiman.com/products/">book or DVD</a> or through one of his <a href="http://dankleiman.com/about/">certified instructors</a>. Tai Chi, a practice developed by practitioners in China, is suitable for people of all ages.</p>
<p>For example, you may have seen a group of people practicing Tai Chi in your local park as you drive to work in the morning, and wondered why those people were stretching out their arms and moving slowly, almost imperceptibly. They are engaging in low-impact activity that helps them regain and maintain their health.</p>
<h2>About Bruce Frantzis</h2><br />
<a title="Bruce Frantzis" href="http://dankleiman.com/bruce-frantzis/">Bruce Frantzis is a master of Tai Chi</a>, with more than 40 years of experience teaching people how to heal themselves with Eastern systems. He spent more 16 years studying in China, India and Japan, and has trained over 20,000 students in Tai Chi, meditation and other Eastern practices that are designed to help people achieve serenity and wellness. He has also certified over 400 instructors from around the world, to help spread his techniques and knowledge.</p>
<p>Frantzis earned a PhD in Health Sciences. A native English speaker, he is also fluent in Chinese and Japanese. To date, he has written eight books about Tai Chi, meditation and other healthful subjects.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Tai Chi</h2><br />
Students in a Bruce Frantzis Tai Chi class will learn all the motions of Tai Chi. The slow movements of Tai Chi are designed to help you store chi, a Chinese term for life force. Rather then exhausting yourself through physically demanding and repetitive exercises, Tai Chi is gentle.</p>
<p>Your goal as a student of Tai Chi is to learn how to pay attention to your body, keep it properly aligned and become more peaceful.</p>
<p>After you have begun to learn the Tai Chi movements in class, you can start performing the same motions at home. It's best to do Tai Chi every day, and you can benefit from the practice by doing it for as little as 15 or 20 minutes each time.</p>
<p>In time, you will find that Tai Chi is an excellent method to help you grow calmer, reduce your stress and anxiety and improve the condition of your body.</p>
