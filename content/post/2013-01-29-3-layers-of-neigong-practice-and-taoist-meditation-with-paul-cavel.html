  content: "I find when I do dragon and tiger first movement before circling hands
    it protects my knee.  \r\nIt was the rocking from heel to toe and tuning into
    the downward release when my heel presses that\r\nAllowed circling hands to get
    my knee opening again.  I was practicing cloud hands to often on an already compressed
    knee which did some serious knee grinding.  Now from time to time after sinking
    my chi I softly test my leg twisting and really only go to 40% .  Again this all
    was gained from Paul's insights from his Inner Quest Journal.  Going to do some
    daoist natural breathing now."

  content: "The previous QR where Paul went into the Soft Tissue, and the progressions
    seemed to set the stage to go into the overall structure concepts.... great that
    the conversation developed to this \"integration\" discussion (about Integration
    of Neigung :) Tu-Earth element of WuXing)\r\n\r\nThx for creating this- asking
    and recording this....  and for presenting this..  I've found insights in some
    of Paul's articles elsewhere (especially Bagua \"concertina\" as he called it)
    of great eloquence and value.. not just for informative value, but inspiration
    (ie a bit of a kick in the butt ~ refresh)   cheers"

  content: "Thanks Dan (and Paul),\r\nGreat \"internal spice!\"\r\nThe complexity
    of energy arts is daunting.\r\nPaul's analysis helps me see the big picture more
    clearly;\r\nit helps me break out of being \"a legend in my own mind whilst just
    moving my arms and legs around.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it throws new light on one of my
    debates with you, Dan, about the role of martial arts in developing spiritual
    awareness.  With Paul's Venn diagrams I can more clearly see how training in power
    production/martial arts  (intermediate level) can enhance the integration level.
    \ I can see how training in martial arts can really create more space in presence
    and awareness."

  content: I realized recently that I've never heard of spontaneous qigong and/or
    shaking practices in Bruce's curriculum. Does anybody know if he teaches them?

  content: "Yes, Bob, I think these three layers really capture how to practice with
    different goals -- building a container, filling it up, and then smoothing it
    out -- and that model guides you through all kinds of applications, as you're
    point to. \r\n\r\nIgor, on spontaneous qigong, I've heard Bruce say that while
    he thinks some of the techniques can be useful, there's a big x factor: you can
    trick yourself into thinking you're releasing a lot, but you might just be reinforcing
    the noise into your system. My sense was that he didn't think the process was
    as clean as dissolving or maybe not as safe on a large scale."

  content: Makes total sense re spontaneous qigong. I've seen experienced  practitioners
    doing spontaneous qigong and they'd do in fact the same set of motions time after
    time. The impression was they got stuck there, so I was curious to what extent
    the qigong was spontaneous.

  content: ":-)\r\n\r\nIn a sense we have the same challenge when we repeat the forms
    over and over again, but I think the framework Paul presents here really shows
    you how to enliven the internal content, for different aims, so that your practice
    never stagnates."

  content: Really cool interview! It helped me understand more clearly the specifics
    and scope of each qigong set of Energy Arts' system. Thank you!

title: 3 Layers of Neigong Practice and Taoist Meditation with Paul Cavel

<p>In this episode of Qigong Radio, Energy Arts Senior Instructor <a href="http://dankleiman.com/tag/paul-cavel/">Paul Cavel</a> explains the 3 different layers of neigong practice:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beginner or Foundational Practices</strong> -- Dragon and Tiger, Opening the Energy Gates, and Heaven and Earth</li>
<li><strong>Intermediate or Power-Production Practices</strong> -- Spiraling Energy Body and Bend the Bow</li>
<li><strong>Advanced or Integration Practices</strong> -- Gods Playing in the Clouds</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4491" alt="3 Layers of Neigong" src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/for_danny-1024x483.jpg" width="717" height="338" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Paul explains what to focus on at each level and how your learning spiral takes you back through them over time.</p><br />
I found Paul's explanation of the relationships between the sets particularly useful. Specifically, understanding <a title="Opening the Energy Gates by Bruce Frantzis is The Most Important Qigong Book To Have in Your Library" href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/10/31/opening-the-energy-gates-by-bruce-frantzis-is-the-most-important-qigong-book-to-have-in-your-library/">Energy Gates</a> as direct preparation for <a title="Spiraling Energy Body Qigong with Isaac Kamins" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/05/28/spiraling-energy-body-qigong-with-isaac-kamins/">Spiraling</a> -- first you clear the downward flow of chi, then you strengthen the upward flow. Similarly, in <a href="http://dankleiman.com/tag/heaven-and-earth/">Heaven and Earth</a> you learn to expand the body (through opening/closing the joints and lengthening the soft tissue) before you really go into deep internal compression in <a href="http://dankleiman.com/tag/bend-the-bow/">Bend the Bow</a>.</p>
<p>As we discussed the meaning of "integration," Paul explained how neigong is the basis for Taoist meditation and where neigong shows up inside your meditation practice.</p>
<p>In the episode, we talk about the great training resources available on <a href="http://paulcavel.com">PaulCavel.com</a>, including the Inner Quest Journal (<a title="Recommended Products" href="https://dankleiman.wufoo.com/forms/q7p5x7/">download a free issue here</a>). If you get the chance, please let Paul know how much we all appreciate the high quality material he is putting out.</p>
