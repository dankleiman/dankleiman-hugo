<p>When you settle into your practice each day, you should always give yourself a couple of minutes to just feel and see where your body, your energy, and your awareness are.</p>
<p>In one sense, each practice session is about bringing the rhythms of each of those into harmony.</p>
<p>That's why Tai Chi and qigong can be so powerfully restorative.</p>
<p>So, if you take a couple of minutes to just "settle in," you'll discover several possible things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your overall energy level.</li>
<li>What feels active and open.</li>
<li>What feels stuck or sluggish.</li>
<li>Specific body parts that are calling out, in good or bad ways.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<h2>Finding New Space in the Feet</h2><br />
The other day, I was settling in to practice and the soles of the feet really stood out (sorry!) from everything else.</p>
<p>Specifically, the toes were hanging from the feet in a way that reminded me of this famous photo of workers having lunch on the beam of the Empire State building. Weird, right?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.afterimagegallery.com/nytconstructionworkers.htm"><img class="aligncenter" alt="nytconstructionworkers" src="/uploads/2014/04/nytconstructionworkers-300x274.jpg" width="300" height="274" /></a></p>
<p>Here's what I think was going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>My ankles were relaxed, allowing the balls of the feet to connect to the ground.</li>
<li>The spaces between the toes opened up, allowing the individual toes to release.</li>
<li>I could feel each toe "hanging" and connecting the ground too.</li><br />
</ul><br />
And why was that like the workers on the beam?</p>
<p>The more I stood and moved with this feeling, the more the ball of the foot -- the beam -- became a support structure I could sink into. The more I sunk into the ball of the foot, the more the toes -- all the workers up there on the beam -- relaxed and let go.</p>
<p>And finally, and this is the part that would freak me out if I were ever anywhere near the top of the Empire State building, <strong>the more I relaxed the more it felt like there was infinite space for my feet to relax down into</strong>.</p>
<p>Isn't that what's so amazing about the photo? The way that the workers are so relaxed and grounded, but they're dangling over hundreds of feet of empty space?</p>
<h2>Creating Your Own Big Sensations from Tiny Spaces</h2><br />
Now, I don't want you to go try to reproduce this sensation. Remember, I didn't set out to do it either. There is a way to practice that makes it more likely that you will have similar experiences, though.</p>
<p><strong>The more time I've spent getting familiar with interior space, through <a title="Energy Gates Dissolving Series" href="http://dankleiman.com/energy-gates-dissolving-series/">Standing Qigong</a>, the more these spaces have opened up. </strong></p>
<p>The trick is to go in with the goal of feeling, not necessarily "opening" or "releasing" or "sinking." Those are all techniques that evolve from feeling.</p>
<p>First you feel, then as the structure, space, and relationships between areas of the body become more familiar, and your overall intention of sinking or rising meld with the well-mapped areas, experiences like this one just seem to pour out from deep inside the body.</p>
<p>Have you bumped into anything like this in your own practice? I'm always curious to hear!</p>
