<p>Happy New Year, everyone!</p>
<p>In the spirit of renewal, new ideas, and new beginnings, we've upgraded the look of the site for 2012.</p>
<p>I'm sure you're thinking about new things to bring into your life in the coming year too...and as it just so happens, I have a couple of ideas for you.</p>
<p>Tune in next week for a special announcement that you won't want to miss if you're a regular reader here.</p>
<p><strong>The thing is, we're only going to tell our newsletter subscribers about it for now.</strong> If you're not already on the list (getting regular blog updates by email), then you probably want to sign up at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>Of course, we'll eventually share the news with everyone through a public blog post too, but not for a few more weeks.</p>
<p>So sign up before Friday to get the special announcement!</p>
<p>I hope 2012 brings you lots of new energy,</p>
<p>Dan</p>
