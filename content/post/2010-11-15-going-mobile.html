<p>This is a test post from my phone. I just installed a Wordpress app for Android. I'm also working on upgrading the blog and the noodle site for easy mobile access.</p>
<p>EDIT: It looks like it picked up the post tags from my phone, but it missed the category. Also have to edit the post author through the site. But you don't really care about that, do you?</p>
