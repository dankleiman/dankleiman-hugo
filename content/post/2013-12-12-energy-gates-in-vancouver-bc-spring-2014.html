  content: I'm interested. I'm down in Eugene and teaching tai chi and qigong with
    a small group of people. I could probably interest a couple of them to learn and
    explore Energy Gates, especially if the workshop were a little closer than BC,
    like Seattle or Portland.

  content: Just getting started with the energy gates teachings and the swings.  I
    live in eastern Washington state but would drive to Vancouver, Seattle, Portland
    or Eugene in March or April for this workshop.  Thanks Dan for your thorough videos.

<p>Do you live in or near Vancouver?</p>
<p>Are you willing to travel to refine your Energy Gates practice?</p>
<p>At the behest of a few eager Vancouver locals, I wanted to reach out and see if any of our Northwest-oriented readers would be interested in a spring 2014 Energy Gates seminar.</p>
<p>Date and exact location haven't been nailed down yet, but if there's enough demand, I would love to come out and do some Energy Gates with you.</p>
<p><a href="https://dankleiman.wufoo.com/forms/rz6mzho0i8y4y5/">Already excited? Sign up here so we can explore it more</a>.</p>
<h2>Energy Gates Seminar Topics</h2><br />
There are so many great Energy Gates subjects related to <a title="3 Essential Questions to Ask Yourself During Standing Qigong" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/07/02/3-essential-questions-to-ask-yourself-during-standing-qigong/">Standing Qigong</a>, <a title="Case Study: Energy Gates Tune-Up" href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/12/21/case-study-energy-gates-tune-up/">Cloud Hands</a>, <a title="The Challenge of the Three Swings" href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/11/16/the-challenge-of-the-three-swings/">The Swings</a>, and <a title="Spinal Qigong Exercises" href="http://dankleiman.com/spinal-qigong-exercises/">The Spine Stretch</a>, but I'd like to take the approach of <strong>answering the burning questions that always come up when you start working on Standing, Sinking and Dissolving,</strong> like:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a lot of tension around my low back (or knees), how do I adapt the posture so it's not painful?</li>
<li>Should I use the actual gates in my practice or focus on general sinking and dissolving?</li>
<li>It is quite a struggle to constantly remind myself to slow down. How do I slow my mind down without causing mental tension?</li>
<li>I'm starting to feel chi when I stand. What do I do with it?</li>
<li>I can't feel chi when I stand. What do I do?</li>
<li>How do I integrate standing, breathing, sinking, and dissolving?</li>
<li>When I sink the chi of one part of my body, does it go all the way down to the ground?</li>
<li>I get too tense when I try to maintain my alignments as I stand. What should I do></li>
<li>I'm experiencing shaking, sweating, heat or other weird bodily sensations. Is that normal?</li><br />
</ul><br />
If you want to get live, personal feedback and soak up all the good chi of intensive group practice, then come stand with us in Vancouver next year!</p>
<p>Fill out the form below and I will in touch directly with you about the details. If we can get a big enough group together, we'll make it happen.</p>
<p>Thanks again to the folks who initiated this conversation!</p>
