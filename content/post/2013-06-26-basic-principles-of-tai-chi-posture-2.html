<p><a href="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/index1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4702" style="margin: 4px 8px;" alt="index" src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/index1-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="112" /></a>The spine is the frame upon which our body hangs and keeping a healthy spine means paying <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/05/14/avoid-bad-tai-chi-posture/">attention to your posture</a>. The way that our body is constructed is quite strong but if you keep negative pressure on an area, especially a joint, it will begin to adjust itself to the new position, which might or might not be natural. When this position is maintained it can actually reshape the joint, causing pain and lack of circulation.</p>
<p>Keeping the spine straight eliminates most of these problems. Keep in mind that problems developed in the spine will always radiate out to the limbs and many problems can actually affect various body systems, such as digestion and circulation. Preventing these problems is as simple as regulating your central equilibrium by paying mindful attention to your body's alignment.  This can be accomplished by practicing regular yoga or Tai Chi, or a combination of both. Tai Chi especially has many different sets that are designed specifically to help heal the spine and keep it healthy.</p>
<p>Because Tai Chi is the "<a href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/12/31/master-wang-hao-da-on-zhong-ding-or-central-equilibrium/">Meditation of Movement</a>" the spine centric exercise actually encourages mindful attention, and inner focus, fostering a new vigilance that will keep your posture straight and healthy. The following three elements are the key:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meditation will help dissipate stress and anxiety, which will also relieve pain.</li>
<li>Breathing that is focused and directed encourages strong circulation, a relaxed body and an increase in the amount of oxygenated blood to the muscles and brain.</li>
<li>Movement in a slow, fluid manner will help  improve the bodies posture by helping you improve your central equilibrium and thereby your body's alignment and your awareness.</li><br />
</ul><br />
There have been many medical studies that have demonstrated the  effectiveness of Tai Chi in relieving stiff necks and back, relieving lower back  pain, treating a compressed lower spine and unstable or weak legs. Most of these problems can be traced to years of bad posture and bad walking habits. Another problem comes when someone has bad posture but is still engaged in high impact exercises. A regular long distance jogger for instance can find themselves in considerable pain after just a few short years of running with bad posture and these problems might begin in the back but will soon radiate out to the legs.<br />
