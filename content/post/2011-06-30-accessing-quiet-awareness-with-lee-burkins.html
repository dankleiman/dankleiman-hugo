  even spontaneously twisting and turning into the  Single Palm Change. "

<p>Our topic this year seemed more esoteric at first, so I was wondering if he'd be able to do the same thing. What  the heck is "Quiet Awareness" and how do you let that run your physical  body? You could see that with many other teachers, this could have been a  2-hour theoretical lecture. Not with Lee. He snuck up on us with really  clear and simple physical exercises, just letting go of tension and  posture through movements. We let ourselves swirl around and find a  sloshing, fluid, sense of internal space. Once people had settled down  into deeper internal awareness, he showed us how to shape an internal  sense of letting go into a solid physical structure and full, alive, and  responsive physical movement. Obviously this is all a little hard to  explain in writing....</p>
<p>The funniest moment though, was after everyone began to really get  what he was driving at, he said, "ok, ok, you're doing it, so let me  give you something to feed your thinking mind too." See, the bigger  point he was driving at was that Quiet Awareness is a different mode for  your mind to be in, and you need that to understand your body, your  mind, and your energy. The internal arts are all about accessing this  mode and manifesting it. The problem is, most of us are trained to use a  different mode of awareness, i.e. the thinking mind. As a masterful  teacher, he recognized that, and with the gentle humor he always uses in  teaching, he graciously gave our thinking minds something to chew on  too.</p>
<h2>Here's the model he shared:</h2></p>
<div><a title="Leaves on river by rstrawser, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14696088@N04/1544960560/"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/1544960560_9e4ba9f9f8_m.jpg" alt="Leaves on river" width="240" height="180" /></a>Lee took the classic Chinese medicine phrase, "the mind moves the chi  and the chi moves the blood" and formulated it as "the Quiet Awareness  moves the chi and the chi moves the fluids inside the body and therefore  the body as well". To really get this concept, he explained it like the  current in a river. Think of a leaf floating along in the river. That's  your body. When the current changes, that's like the chi shifting. It  shifts direction (inward to outward, up to down), because your Quiet  Awareness shifts first. The interesting part is the lag time between  the change of the current and movement of the leaf. Your Quiet Awareness  turns over, the chi follows, and so does the leaf, but as you are learning  to tune into this process, you can feel the leaf moving along the old  current pattern, even as the current is going a different direction.  Those are the circular transitions you feel in your form.</div><br />
I don't know if I quite captured what we did or what Lee was  aiming to teach, but if you ever do get a chance to work with him, take  it. He's a kind and generous teacher and the naturalness of his art form  that pours out is a real treasure. <a href="http://coloradointernalarts.com/practitioners.htm">Lee lives and teaches in Colorado</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>In his own words: </strong></h2><br />
I followed up with Lee to see if this recap came close to capturing what he was teaching. Here's how he describes the process:</p>
<blockquote><p>Adjusting the mind's frequency to smoothly transition from  the&Acirc; vibration&Acirc; of the intellectual aspect to approach and begin to  connect with the vibration/frequency of the intuitive mind. Once you  'experience' this shift in frequency and are able to stay in this mode  (a posture of the mind), 'what is hidden will be revealed', ie, the  connection of the quiet awareness to the chi to the body (nerves,  fluids, and tissues).</blockquote></p>
