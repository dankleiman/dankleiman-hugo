<p><strong>Introducing a new series: "Rhythm as Relaxation".</strong> Across many different practices, which I'll go into one at a time, rhythm is a common thread. When you find the right rhythm in the practice, it gets easier, smoother, more connected, and as a result, more relaxing to perform and more energizing at the same time.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-802"></a></p>
<p>Some of the practices I will explore in the series:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running</li>
<li>Tai Chi</li>
<li>Breathing</li>
<li>Five Element Theory</li><br />
</ul><br />
I'm going to argue that the practices on that list have more in common than not, when you look at them from a rhythm point of view.&Acirc;  I always try to be careful not to conflate different things that have common elements, because then you usually miss the depth and richness of both, but I will try to show you how focusing on the rhythm in each activity will make it easier and more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
