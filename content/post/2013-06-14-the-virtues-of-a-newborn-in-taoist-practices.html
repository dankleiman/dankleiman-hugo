<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/WuWeiTaoistArts"><img src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Lao-Tzu-223x300.jpg" alt="Lao Tzu Statue courtesy of Wu Wei Taoist Arts" width="223" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4684" /></a>In all Taoist practices, there is a theme of moving like a newborn. We look to the softness, connectedness, and smoothness of their movements to re-learn and relax how we normally get around. </p>
<p><a href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/01/30/my-favorite-breathing-hack/" title="My Favorite Breathing Hack">Taoist breathing</a> trains you to move your belly, sides, and back in a gentle compress and release pattern that tones the internal organs.</p>
<p>The Opening and Closing of the joints that we train in the <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/02/15/the-marriage-of-heaven-and-earth-qigong/" title="The Marriage of Heaven and Earth Qigong">Marriage of Heaven and Earth qigong</a>, teaches you how to minimize muscular force and lead your movements from the natural hydraulic pumps in the joints and cavities of the body. </p>
<p>In <a href="http://dankleiman.com/wu-short-form/" title="Wu Short Form">Tai Chi</a> we follow the principle that, "when one part moves, all parts move." You can clearly see the wriggles and squirms of an infant engaging and connecting "all parts."</p>
<p>This week, I have been blessed with a newborn son of my own, and he doesn't know it yet (or maybe he does?), but he will be my new teacher as I watch him move, grow, and explore the world around him.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://terebess.hu/english/tao/wu.html#Kap55">Chapter 55 of the Tao Te Ching</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<img src="http://dankleiman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Danny-and-Owen-168x300.jpg" alt="Danny and Owen" width="168" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4685" />ONE who is steeped in Virtue is akin to the new-born babe.<br />
Wasps and poisonous serpents do not sting it,<br />
Nor fierce beasts seize it,<br />
Nor birds of prey maul it.<br />
Its bones are tender, its sinews soft,<br />
But its grip is firm.<br />
It has not known the union of the male and the female,<br />
Growing in its wholeness, and keeping its vitality in its perfect integrity.<br />
It howls and screams all day long without getting hoarse,<br />
Because it embodies perfect harmony.</p>
<p>To know harmony is to know the Changeless.<br />
To know the Changeless is to have insight.</p>
<p>To hasten the growth of life is ominous.<br />
To control the breath by the will is to overstrain it.<br />
To be overgrown is to decay.<br />
All this is against Tao,<br />
And whatever is against Tao soon ceases to be.<br />
</blockquote><br />
I'll let you know what I learn along the Way! </p>
