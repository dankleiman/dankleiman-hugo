  content: "Thanks for posting that Dan, I always enjoy hearing the latest from qigong
    radio - but that was different.  That was real and raw , deep and beautiful.  I
    don't think too many people would come at it from that angle and focus on something
    non-linear and instead focus topic which maybe pertinent but more obvious.  It's
    all good - just sayin I think it's so cool how you think outside of the box like
    that:)\r\nI think its healthy to strive less in our practice - allowing the natural
    rhythms of life shape our practice and vice versa. Not sure if this is something
    you were referring to but I think it's related.  I've observed that my personal
    practice has a significant impact on my day including my energy levels, attitude,
    sensitivity - my relationship with life.  At more advanced levels Id imagine these
    benefits would increase dramatically.\r\nSo, now reflecting on the episode and
    my personal experience I think it is important to establish a regular practice
    rhythm but as long as it is natural and does not stagnate.  To remain open and
    accepting the changes that life brings and change our practice rhythm or set with
    this change.  I think this is key to allowing change of life to flow through into
    our practice.  In this way I think will we be better able to grow from change
    and flow with change.\r\nI think you have opened a big beautiful can of opportunity
    for people to reflect on their own personal life/practice and I would love to
    hear other peoples perspective.\r\nThanks for sharing Dan:)"

  content: Thanks, Kevin. "allowing the natural rhythms of life shape our practice
    and vice versa" at the end of the day, why would you want to keep your practice
    at arm's lengthen, treating it like an object you've acquired? I'd much rather
    assimilate it and let it become as natural as eating, sleeping, and breathing.

  content: "Change.  Exchange.  Inchange.  Inchange.  Exchange.  Change.  \r\n\r\nThank
    you.  I loved hearing this one. \r\n\r\nI am in the midst of noticing how my current
    big external change (moving from Brookline, MA to Alaska) is reshaping my internal.
    \ It's pretty neat.  Thank you for the focus on this topic and speaking about
    it.  \r\n\r\nBrendan"

  content: "I've been having a lot of fun learning the exercises in Mr.Tangora's Cloud
    Hands book.  I've just finished learning them all and have been practicing them
    nearly everyday.  Even after learning the first move or two I began to notice
    its impact on my cloud hands.  Now, I'll do all the exercises followed by cloud
    hands at the end.  My cloud hands has improved immensely.  It feels so connected
    and smooth and balanced.  I realize the importance of training witha live instructor
    and I hope I get a chance to train with an EA instructor one day  but it's been
    3 years and I've yet to attend a class.  Needless to say I'm really pleased with
    how the exercises I this book in combination with Dan's amazing feedback and online
    materials/Instruction has improved my practice.  I'm looking forward to diving
    deeper into these simple yet profound practices.\r\nThank You."
