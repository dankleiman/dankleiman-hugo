<p>In this "office hours" post, Nate asked me about kwa work in Tai Chi. Specifically, we were looking at movements where you squat in a front stance. The question is figuring out how low to go and why.</p>
<p>In Tai Chi, you use your kwa to control your movements. At first, think of your kwa as simply the fold in your hip joint. In the following video, though, I explain how your understanding, and use, of the kwa changes as you learn to work deeper into the body.<br />

<p>In your practice, you should be clear about which skill you are practicing. Learn how to do each of these three:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fold the kwa</li>
<li>Bend and Stretch from the kwa</li>
<li>Pump the kwa</li><br />
</ol><br />
As you progress through these different skills, your sense of how to articulate the kwa changes. In the next two videos, I go on to show Nate how to hollow his kwa, which allows him to squat lower and govern how low he goes while staying aligned and connected.</p>
<p>Then, we look at how the hollowing action allows you to release excess tension and holding in the lower spine.</p>
