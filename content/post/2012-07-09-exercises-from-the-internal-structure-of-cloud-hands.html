  content: "Just a follow-up to Kevin's comment in <a href=\"http://dankleiman.com/2012/06/25/on-expectations-and-progress-in-your-qigong-practice/comment-page-1/#comment-1727\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">this thread</a>:\r\n<em>One question I have about the book is
    in its title and this may be quite obvious to some but Im curious how cloud hands
    and its internal structure is related to the exercises taught in the book?</em>\r\n\r\nRobert
    characterizes 3 types of power that are expressed in Tai Chi. I like to think
    about them as 3 different ways to connect up your body, mind, and energy. These
    exercises are designed to develop these movement skills, which you then integrate
    into the Cloud Hands pattern. Ultimately, the Cloud Hands pattern is a template
    from which you extrapolate all the particular applications and variations you
    find in the form. \r\n\r\nSo it's a three-step process: find the connections with
    the exercises, put them together in Cloud Hands, play with them in the form and
    applications."

  content: Thanks Dan , so you do you apply the inner form of these exercises to the
    cloud hands movement?

  content: Yeah, exactly. For example, the Turning Post exercise above gives you a
    sense for the push and pull of the legs turning the waist. When you do Tai Chi
    Cloud Hands or any other movement from the form, you want the same feeling of
    the legs turning the waist. Robert refers to this as part of  "Cross-Body Power."
    I would practice the Turning Post exercise until you find that feeling, then do
    the complete Cloud Hands movement and see if you can find the same internal connection.

  content: "Cool. I'm really looking forward to practicing.\r\nSo, this could be a
    meaty question that I may find the answer to in the book -\r\nCan all the different
    Internal work from these exercises be applied to movements other than cloud hands
    such as other tai chi or chi gung movements for instance?"

  content: My understanding has been that virtually every bodily movement will have
    almost all 16 components of neigong to a greater or lesser degree. This is why
    I'm drawn to Bruces system. Before that I studied in a school that would teach
    a taiji form after form with endless sets of movements so that after 2 years I
    felt I was at the same beginner level as I had started. Whereas Bruce (and now
    Robert Tangora) takes a simple single movement and explains how neigong components
    are incorporated.

  content: "I'm really glad I bought this book.  Having skimmed through it, I can
    already tell it will keep me busy with not only learning the exercises but the
    information contained within is incredible and will keep me studying for many
    moons !  \r\nI like that he's included a lot of advanced material so that as I
    progress I can understand what's going on internally.  So, right now I find myself
    re-reading a lot so I know what it is he's referring to in the instruction or
    theory.\r\nI've been working on commencement for about a week and I'm wondering
    how long should I be typically practicing these exercises until incorporating
    the next?\r\nSaying that, I fully reallize that after learning the outer form
    there is ALOT of room and time to be refining each move.\r\nThanks\r\nKevin"

  content: "Hey Kevin,\r\n\r\nIt's a pretty circular process, so I would say you should
    try to get a basic version of all the exercises down as soon as you can. You'll
    get into a rhythm and the movements will become more ingrained, so you can free
    up your focus to get the internal connections going.\r\n\r\nHave fun with these!\r\nDan"

<p>One of the toughest parts of learning movement exercises from a book is knowing what goes in between each still photo.</p>
<p>That's why I'm very excited that Robert Tangora has put out an overview video of all the exercises that he teaches in the <a title="The Internal Structure of Cloud Hands by Robert Tangora" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/06/18/the-internal-structure-of-cloud-hands-by-robert-tangora/">Internal Structure of Cloud Hands</a>.</p>

<p>You can use this video as a companion guide to the book.</p>
<p>I think this book is such an excellent resource, that I'm urging every serious Tai Chi and qigong practitioner that I know to find a way to work it into theirs.</p>
<p>For the months of July, August, and September, I'm dedicating a portion of my daily practice time to the material in Robert's book. I'm calling it the 90-Day Cloud Hands Challenge.</p>
<h2>Why I'm Excited about The Internal Structure of Cloud Hands</h2><br />
I've studied with Robert for several years, mainly when he comes to Boston to teach seminars, and we've worked on several different pieces of his system -- this book ties them all together. I wish I had had this from the beginning!</p>
<p>The book is also a road map for infusing your Tai Chi practice will all of the main principles found in the complete Energy Arts curriculum <strong>(see below, I want to share my notes on this with you)</strong>.</p>
<p>He's collected simple (but profound, and not necessarily easy) exercises that lay out all the building blocks for your Cloud Hands practice and described them in the book. And now we have the video reference to go with them.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a way to boost your personal practice, no matter where you're coming from with it, setting a 90-day goal of honing one skill, or repeatedly delving into one set of exercises can be a great way to do it. 90 days is enough time to really immerse yourself, but also short enough so it doesn't feel endless.</p>
<p>The book and video just coming out is the perfect trigger to set you off on a 90-day challenge of your own.</p>
<h2>My Personal Practice Notes</h2><br />
Since I'm in the process of weaving the Cloud Hands material together with my normal Energy Arts practice, I started mapping out the links I was seeing between them.</p>
<p>These are just rough outlines I've put together. Think "work in progress", "musings", or "scratchpad." I'm not claiming anything definitive!</p>
<p>Still, if you'd like to check them out, drop your email in the form below and I'll send you my notes.</p>
