<p>Can you take 5 minutes to help me with a survey?</p>
<p>I'm compiling a report on the state of Tai Chi. I want to know what teachers and practitioners think is important about their Tai Chi practice.</p>
<p>We're also trying to figure out where Tai Chi stacks up for people who don't do Tai Chi, but have another movement/wellness practice.</p>
<p><a href="http://dankleiman.com/tai-chi-state-of-the-art/">You can take the survey here</a> and if you could help me spread the word about it too, that would be great.</p>
<p>Early next year, the plan is to release our findings as a free report. Stay tuned!</p>
