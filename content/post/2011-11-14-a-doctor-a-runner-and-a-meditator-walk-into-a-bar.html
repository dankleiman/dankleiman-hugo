<p>And they're all in pain!</p>
<p>When it comes to the aches and pains of moving around, you might be in pain from your day job, your vigorous exercise routine, or even a mindfulness practice that doesn't involve any movement. Ever wonder why? <a id="more"></a><a id="more-2285"></a></p>
<p>The reason is exactly the same in each case: in your pre-conscious mind, you are basically trying to outsource your own movement patterns, from a body part that should be doing the job, to one that's willing to, even though it isn't designed for that job!</p>
<p>If that doesn't completely make sense, watch this video:</p>
<p><object width="420" height="315" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nFvmbc5At-U?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="420" height="315" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nFvmbc5At-U?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>Those aches and pains might be caused by one big inappropriate act of outsourcing. If you think that's what's going on, you should definitely check out the Joint Mobility tips over on the <a href="http://dankleiman.com/get-moving/">Get Moving</a> page.</p>
