<p>In the process of building and launching <a href="http://www.trainerfly.com/" target="_blank">Trainerfly</a>, I've tried to keep the wisdom of Bruce Lee in mind:</p>
<p><object width="480" height="385" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/sDW6vkuqGLg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="480" height="385" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/sDW6vkuqGLg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>Too many people are "looking at the finger" when they think of technology. What's the point of lightning fast communication and access to an abundance of information? It has to come back to people communicating. Otherwise, it just doesn't mean a thing.</p>
<p>I hope that the proliferation of fast, ubiquitous communication technology accelerates so much, that people finally get beyond the finger-fascination and can start looking at the moon -- in all its heavenly glory -- again.</p>
