<p>In Tai Chi, the "Dragon" refers to the twisting and turning motions made with the body, usually in support of the turning of the head and neck, as when we change the direction of our gaze. Learning to turn the head correctly, supported by a rooted stance and a flexible torso, is an essential component of good balance.</p>
<p>The following exercise is the beginning version of Tai Chi Dragon exercises, suitable for all levels.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Start with your feet a little wider than shoulder width, weight equally distributed on both feet. Feel that your stance is firm, and rooted into the ground.<br />

Raise your right hand and point with one or two fingers at a spot on the wall (if inside) or an object or point on the visual horizon (if outside) that is the left corner of your visual field&mdash;that is, "Northwest" if you are facing north, or 10.30 if you are at the center of an imaginary clock face, facing 12. Your left hand rests at your hip, in a lightly closed fist.<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">Slowly, sweep your hand across the horizon from left to right, looking where your finger points and allowing your trunk to twist gently in the direction of your gaze. Keep your feet firmly planted and make sure the legs remain firm; the head and trunk twist, but the legs do not.<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">When your hand and gaze reach the right hand corner ("Northeast"), bring the hand in toward your body,<br />
closing the fingers into a light fist. Rest this hand on your hip and now extend the left hand to the right corner, pointing and gazing at the same point.<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">Pay attention to your legs, your stance, your balance, even as you are changing your gaze and your upper body position.</p><br />
Slowly repeat the sweep, now going from right to left. Change hands, repeat once or twice more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4779" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 2px solid #993300;" alt="DragonScans5" src="/uploads/2013/08/DragonScans5.jpg" width="429" height="250" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is a complex exercise but once mastered, confers enormous benefits. Maintaining your balance as your eyes move is a critically important skill!<br />
